BEAT-BY-BEAT OUTLINE
I. KI — INTRODUCTION

The matchmaker already exists. The world is in quiet equilibrium.

1. Opening image: the check with a suggestion

A regular customer (or a traveler passing through) studies the bottom of his diner receipt.
A single printed line reads:

“Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.”

He blinks at it, bemused, amused, slightly unnerved.

2. Frankie’s casual explanation

He asks Frankie what this is. She treats it as trivial:

“Augusta’s project. People say it works. I just run the place.”

She’s tired, competent, warm in a non-demonstrative way.

3. Quick glimpses of other customers engaging with it

Small suggestions on their receipts:

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

“Jogging partner.”

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”
These teeter between absurd and insightful.

4. Establishing the tone of techno-magical realism

The diner feels subtly enchanted:

The receipt printer spits at odd rhythms, as if thinking.

The hum of the appliances feels like a shared breath.

The AI’s suggestions are weirdly appropriate, but nobody knows why.

Established: Magic is mundane. Data is alive. No one questions it.

II. SHO — DEVELOPMENT

How Augusta created the matchmaker. The past stirs.

5. Augusta arrives to help Frankie “clean up”

The diner is closed one morning.
Augusta has come to help clear the storage room.

Somewhere in the dialogue:

Johnny is absent.

His name is invoked softly.

Perhaps Augusta says, “He always meant to organize this,” with tenderness.

No mention of death. But the air carries it.

6. The discovery of the boxes

They find hundreds of boxes labeled in Johnny’s handwriting:

“Receipts A-D, 1998–2003”

“Pie Orders”

“Tippers (GOOD!)”

Frankie is embarrassed; Augusta is fascinated.

7. Augusta’s idea — digitizing Johnny’s receipts

Augusta begins scanning them “so they won’t mold away.”
She notices patterns:

Johnny annotating emotions.

Johnny circling oddly paired orders.

Little arrows linking separate receipts.

8. The magical phenomenon emerges

After scanning tens of thousands of receipts:

The system begins generating connections no one typed in.

Names appear together that Johnny never linked.

The printer prints spontaneously.

Patterns cross decades with eerie accuracy.

Augusta and Frankie shrug, then accept it.
(Techno-magical realism at its most natural.)

9. The matchmaker becomes a hit

Soon:

Tourists ask for “matchmaker receipts.”

Locals swear it saved their marriages, art projects, friendships.

A journalist writes a piece about the “receipt prophet.”

The diner is now a node of gentle magic.

III. TEN — COMPLICATION

A sudden shift: a corporate dystonia. Confusion, chaos, algorithmic harm.

10. Hard cut to a corporate office

A jarring tonal shift: glass, noise, monitors.
People being reshuffled into new teams weekly.
Slack channels changing names.
Nobody understands the logic behind decisions.

11. The “pairing algorithm”

Employees are told:

“We match partners based on productivity adjacency.
Trust the process.”

It’s opaque and ominously cheerful.

12. Enter Mathi

Mathi learns his entire team has been terminated overnight.
He’s assigned a new partner via a cryptic code:
PAIR-7C4-ALN.Z
(Which quietly echoes diner receipt formatting.)

He’s disoriented but resigned.

13. Meeting his new partner — the narrator of The Game

Mathi meets his newly assigned partner: Alma Church (or whichever name you choose).
She’s calm, precise in her speech, observant without being intense.

During their first conversation, she glances at her phone and apologizes lightly:

“Sorry — my sister and I play correspondence chess.
It’s my move.”

That’s it.
No exposition. No elaboration.
A tiny, almost throwaway gesture that subtly ties her to The Game’s narrator without drawing attention to it.

This choice keeps the worlds connected without calling attention to the connection.

14. Instant synergy

They talk. They think the same way.
They order lunch together—the same thing.
There’s humor in their overlap.
Something about their connection feels fated, not engineered.

15. Strange revelations at work

People mention:

“Your lunch choices matter here.”

“Don’t expense the wrong thing.”

“Try not to eat alone.”

Hints accumulate that lunch receipts are being used as data in the pairing algorithm.

Corporate misuse of data is the distortion of the diner’s warmth.

16. Rising tension

Chaos escalates at the company.
Pairings get nonsensical.
Human intuition is ignored.
Good people fired; bad matches forced.

Mathi and Alma realize they work well together despite the company—
not because of it.

IV. KETSU — RESOLUTION / HARMONY

Time jump to the future. The uses of data diverge: one destructive, one humane.

17. Future scene: back at the diner — the climate project

Mathi and Alma sit together at a corner table in the diner. Laptops open, empty plates pushed aside.

They’re working on something climate-focused — a tree-planting coordination app:

maybe it predicts micro-climates for ideal planting

or matches volunteers with under-resourced neighborhoods

or connects local nurseries with community groups

It should feel practical, hopeful, and modest in scope:
tech as a tool for repair, not disruption.

They’re doing it because they enjoy it, not because anyone told them to.

The diner hums around them. The matchmaker prints occasionally for other patrons. Their own table is simply… peaceful.

18. The corporation’s collapse

Narratively efficient reveal:

The corporation attempted to automate synergy by analyzing every employee’s reimbursed lunch receipts.

They assumed order similarity = compatibility.

It failed disastrously.

The company imploded from its own misguided certainty.

19. Frankie and Augusta’s insight

They’ve discovered (through observation, not ambition) that the matchmaker is great not just for romance but collaboration.
They start gently offering suggestions like:

“Partner for a film project.”

“Someone who codes like you.”

And it works.

20. The Diner Network Idea

Frankie has sketches for new diner-coworking locations.
Not corporate expansion—just spreading a good thing.
Whether or not you name it The Vine and Fig Tree, the spirit is:

Community

Shelter

Flourishing

Non-coercive pairing

21. Closing gesture (less heavy-handed, more natural)

The printer chugs and spits out a receipt for their lunch.

Frankie drops it off without comment.

Mathi glances at it, expecting the total — but there’s an extra line, small and almost incidental:

“Good team.”

No names.
No imperative.
No “suggested match.”
Just a quiet affirmation, as if the system is noticing what’s already true.

They share a grin, or maybe they don’t. They simply keep working.

The magic remains understated and human-aligned:
never prescriptive, just observant.
