BEAT-BY-BEAT OUTLINE
I. KI — INTRODUCTION

The matchmaker already exists. The world is in quiet equilibrium.

1. Opening image: the check with a suggestion

A regular customer (or a traveler passing through) studies the bottom of his diner receipt.
A single printed line reads:

“Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.”

He blinks at it, bemused, amused, slightly unnerved.

2. Frankie’s casual explanation

He asks Frankie what this is. She treats it as trivial:

“Augusta’s project. People say it works. I just run the place.”

She’s tired, competent, warm in a non-demonstrative way.

3. Quick glimpses of other customers engaging with it

Small suggestions on their receipts:

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

“Jogging partner.”

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”
These teeter between absurd and insightful.

4. Establishing the tone of techno-magical realism

The diner feels subtly enchanted:

The receipt printer spits at odd rhythms, as if thinking.

The hum of the appliances feels like a shared breath.

The AI’s suggestions are weirdly appropriate, but nobody knows why.

Established: Magic is mundane. Data is alive. No one questions it.

II. SHO — DEVELOPMENT

How Augusta created the matchmaker. The past stirs.

5. Augusta arrives to help Frankie “clean up”

The diner is closed one morning.
Augusta has come to help clear the storage room.

Somewhere in the dialogue:

Johnny is absent.

His name is invoked softly.

Perhaps Augusta says, “He always meant to organize this,” with tenderness.

No mention of death. But the air carries it.

6. The discovery of the boxes

They find hundreds of boxes labeled in Johnny’s handwriting:

“Receipts A-D, 1998–2003”

“Pie Orders”

“Tippers (GOOD!)”

Frankie is embarrassed; Augusta is fascinated.

7. Augusta’s idea — digitizing Johnny’s receipts

Augusta begins scanning them “so they won’t mold away.”
She notices patterns:

Johnny annotating emotions.

Johnny circling oddly paired orders.

Little arrows linking separate receipts.

8. The magical phenomenon emerges

After scanning tens of thousands of receipts:

The system begins generating connections no one typed in.

Names appear together that Johnny never linked.

The printer prints spontaneously.

Patterns cross decades with eerie accuracy.

Augusta and Frankie shrug, then accept it.
(Techno-magical realism at its most natural.)

9. The matchmaker becomes a hit

Soon:

Tourists ask for “matchmaker receipts.”

Locals swear it saved their marriages, art projects, friendships.

A journalist writes a piece about the “receipt prophet.”

The diner is now a node of gentle magic.

III. TEN — COMPLICATION

A sudden shift: a corporate dystonia. Confusion, chaos, algorithmic harm.

10. Hard cut to a corporate office

A jarring tonal shift: glass, noise, monitors.
People being reshuffled into new teams weekly.
Slack channels changing names.
Nobody understands the logic behind decisions.

11. The “pairing algorithm”

Employees are told:

“We match partners based on productivity adjacency.
Trust the process.”

It’s opaque and ominously cheerful.

12. Enter Mathi

Mathi learns his entire team has been terminated overnight.
He’s assigned a new partner via a cryptic code:
PAIR-7C4-ALN.Z
(Which quietly echoes diner receipt formatting.)

He’s disoriented but resigned.

13. Meeting his new partner — the narrator of The Game

She introduces herself with the chosen name (e.g., Alma Church).
Hints subtly tie her to The Game:

A mannerism of meticulous thinking

A notebook with game design sketches

A sentence structure reminiscent of her narrative voice

Mathi recognizes in her the calm clarity he's been missing.

14. Instant synergy

They talk. They think the same way.
They order lunch together—the same thing.
There’s humor in their overlap.
Something about their connection feels fated, not engineered.

15. Strange revelations at work

People mention:

“Your lunch choices matter here.”

“Don’t expense the wrong thing.”

“Try not to eat alone.”

Hints accumulate that lunch receipts are being used as data in the pairing algorithm.

Corporate misuse of data is the distortion of the diner’s warmth.

16. Rising tension

Chaos escalates at the company.
Pairings get nonsensical.
Human intuition is ignored.
Good people fired; bad matches forced.

Mathi and Alma realize they work well together despite the company—
not because of it.

IV. KETSU — RESOLUTION / HARMONY

Time jump to the future. The uses of data diverge: one destructive, one humane.

17. Future scene: back at the diner

Mathi and Alma sit in “their” booth at the diner.
They are relaxed, warm, building a collaborative passion project:

Could be open-source civic tech

Could be community matchmaking

Could be some educational platform

Something small, human, good.

18. The corporation’s collapse

Narratively efficient reveal:

The corporation attempted to automate synergy by analyzing every employee’s reimbursed lunch receipts.

They assumed order similarity = compatibility.

It failed disastrously.

The company imploded from its own misguided certainty.

19. Frankie and Augusta’s insight

They’ve discovered (through observation, not ambition) that the matchmaker is great not just for romance but collaboration.
They start gently offering suggestions like:

“Partner for a film project.”

“Someone who codes like you.”

And it works.

20. The Diner Network Idea

Frankie has sketches for new diner-coworking locations.
Not corporate expansion—just spreading a good thing.
Whether or not you name it The Vine and Fig Tree, the spirit is:

Community

Shelter

Flourishing

Non-coercive pairing

21. Closing gesture

The printer spits out a receipt.
Frankie reads it, smiles.

She hands it to Mathi and Alma.

Suggested Match: each other (again).
Project: keep going.

Light, warm, understated.

22. Final note

A subtle callback to Johnny:

Frankie touches his old mug

Or a photo on the wall

Or a line in his handwriting on a recipe card
Nothing explicit.

The magic continues because people use it kindly.
