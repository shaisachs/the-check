1. Core Premise

Frankie runs her diner like a community hub. People come alone but end up talking — she’s proud of that. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows your name, in a small-town, not-quite-modern sense.

Augusta, a brilliant but somewhat distant engineer, sets up a chatbot on the diner’s ordering system — something simple at first. Maybe it’s just an experimental feature on the digital check system (e.g., customers order through tablets, or text their orders).

It starts small:

“Try our new friendly assistant, The CheckBot — it remembers your order and can introduce you to other regulars with similar tastes!”

At first, it’s charming. People love the attention. They joke about it matchmaking them by “coffee compatibility.” Frankie humors it because it brings in customers.

But over time, something changes: the matches stop making sense. A widower gets paired with a teenager; an old regular gets messages meant for someone else; the bot starts suggesting matches between the living and dead, or between people who haven’t come in for years. It’s still working — but it’s trained on a decaying record of who people were, not who they are now.

The creepiness grows subtly — not through “malfunction” but through eerie accuracy of memory divorced from time.

2. How the Matchmaking System Works (Diegetically)

Keep it low-tech and plausible-with-a-twist — “techno-magical realism” style, not science fiction.

Maybe Augusta’s system isn’t online — it’s local, trained purely on Frankie’s decades of digitized receipts and customer notes.

It learns that:

People who order the same pie tend to get along.

Certain patterns of meals predict loneliness or routine.

The same handwriting on multiple checks implies shared histories.

But what it can’t know is time. It treats all data as equally current. So when it reaches into old data — maybe the checks Augusta scanned included the names of customers long gone — it resurrects them into conversation.

A customer gets a message through the system:
“‘Tom’ thinks you’d enjoy a slice of cherry pie with your lunch today.”
Frankie freezes — Tom died five years ago.

Augusta insists it’s “just a coincidence,” but Frankie knows her diner better. These are her ghosts.

3. How to Show the System Losing Context (Not Tell It)

The trick is to reveal decay through lived experience, not exposition. Here are some show-don’t-tell techniques:

Scene 1 — Charm

Frankie chats with a regular as they try the chatbot. It nails a match:

“You and Helen both love lemon meringue on Wednesdays.”
The two laugh, share a slice. It feels magical.

Scene 2 — Unease

Later, it pairs two people awkwardly:

“You and Patrick should meet — you ordered the same breakfast last week.”
But Patrick is Augusta’s intern, 40 years younger. Everyone chuckles, but the mood shifts.

Scene 3 — Ghost in the Data

One night, Frankie stays late, checks the dashboard (or the printed slips). She notices names she hasn’t seen in years appearing in new match suggestions.
She prints one out: “Ellie (Table 4) would enjoy coffee with Martin (Table 2).” But Ellie’s seat is empty — and Martin’s been dead a decade.

Scene 4 — The Confrontation

Frankie accuses Augusta of using old data irresponsibly. Augusta defends it: “It’s just patterns. It doesn’t know what death is.”
But Frankie feels that it does know — it’s remembering too well. The difference between remembrance and resurrection collapses.

Scene 5 — Collapse

Maybe the system begins addressing Frankie herself:

“You used to have lunch with Tom on Thursdays. Would you like to invite him again?”
Now she’s the one being “matched,” trapped inside her own dataset.
The machine doesn’t fail — it simply forgets that humans move on.

Scene 6 — Resolution

Frankie turns it off, quietly.
But the last scene lingers: someone walks in and asks,

“Is that matchmaking thing still around? It introduced me to my husband.”
Frankie smiles sadly. “No, hon. It’s back to just us now.”

That line — “just us now” — can serve as both emotional and thematic closure: data fades, but human memory endures.

4. Thematic Core

Theme:
The danger isn’t malevolent AI — it’s data without time, memory without forgetting.
Augusta’s invention preserves connections but strips them of context, turning intimacy into repetition. Frankie realizes that forgetting — imperfection, loss — is part of what makes community real.

Frankie’s arc:
From curious acceptance → unease → recognition → quiet rebellion (turning it off).
She’s the “victim,” but not of harm — of being misunderstood by her own reflection.

5. Story Mood & Style

Stylistically, this could feel like Black Mirror meets Raymond Carver — spare, small-town dialogue, no exposition dump, just the slow encroachment of the uncanny.

Let the tone oscillate between warm diner normalcy and creeping unreality: sugar packets, coffee refills, and the hum of a system that knows too much.
