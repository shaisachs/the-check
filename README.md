# The Check

Frankie's head bent over the calculator, strands of wavy hair floating in the breeze of the fan and occasionally bothering her figures. As her fingers flew across the keys the printer tape advanced steadily outward, spilling past the edge of the desk and onto the floor.

She enjoyed spinning the thread of numbers in this way, though it was an arduous task that she regretted in hindsight every quarter. There was something pure in the ache of it all, something noble about making these little slips of papers, these greasy old receipts, gather together into a nice, tidy column.

She finished a stack and looked up, as though someone else might have been standing over her. But there was no one in the cramped little office, just her desk and a chair opposite, struggling under the weight of a full years' worth of grubby paperworkj.

A year had passed since Johnny had died.

Once the initial shock faded, and the funeral passed, and the stream of mourners slowed to a trickle, Frankie reopened the diner. At first it seemed like an insult to his memory, to hire a line cook to take his place. The new kid was brash, moved fast, flipped pancakes as though she'd been doing it since birth. With time, Frankie realized that the reopening was exactly what she needed. The routine of opening the doors each morning, the flow of boisterous customers, the sizzle of eggs cracking over the griddle - it all felt right, somehow. Surely Johnny would have approved.

The loneliness was its own kind of company, she found. The bare lightbulb hanging overhead, a single beam of light illuminating the dusty and windowless office - there was nothing she preferred, when working on the books. There was a reason she didn't camp out at a booth in the diner, as Johnny sometimes liked to do, to be enveloped by the clatter of plates and the gurgle of chatter at the other tables. Why bother with all the well-wishers who would inevitably pass by, when she had a perfectly nice box of receipts at her fingertips?

It was not the greasy food that took Johnny away, surprisingly. He sampled his own wares quite freely, but never had so much as an uncomfortable checkup at the doctor's. Something of a modern miracle, the doctor used to say, a cook at a greasy spoon with a healthy ticker. Johnny liked to repeat that line often, it was like a magical talisman decorating his neck. Frankie sometimes wondered if it was the repetition itself which brought him good health; doctors always had tricks like that up their sleeves.

Frankie got up, stretched, put on her jacket and went outside through the back door. Didn't even bother with stashing her keys in her pocket. Across the street from a diner was a tiny little park, just a scrap of grass really, but at the far edge stood a copse of pine trees. It was a nice spot to relax from time to time, the sort of place she could let her mind wander. The bench underneath was rarely inhabited, and Frankie planted herself there. Through the branches of the tree, little spindles of afternoon light fell on the ground, forming a pattern she couldn't quite discern.

Johnny did not observe many rituals in his time, but he did have a habit of writing out receipts for his own lunches at the diner. It was a funny thing to do, and at first Frankie supposed that he was trying to help her keep the books intact - not that it really made much difference. But that wasn't it after all, because she found that more often than not he didn't even know that she had paid taxes. It was several years after starting the diner that he discovered they had any kind of budget at all. Perhaps the mounting collection of receipts was his own kind of journal, a slow and small testament to his daily life. It was impossible to know. One way or the other, she was left with a box full of her husband's accumulated lunch orders, about the weight and heft of a skein of wool. It was these that she placed on the bench beside her, thrumming the lid absently with her fingers.

It was a quiet afternoon, with only a few birds hopping among the branches of the trees above her. Occasionally she'd hear the chirpy report of a sparrow, the trilled complaint of a robin. She could not quite name the reason she had brought the box with her. She had left the diner was to get away from work for a minute, she certainly didn't intend to bring it with her. She had other keepsakes of Johnny's, an old jacket and a favorite basbeall, countless spatulas. She didn't really want those today. She opened the lid and sifted the greasy scraps of paper through her fingers.

A whole season had gone by, once, when Johnny had nothing but eggs and toast for lunch. He swore by it as though it was the perfect lunch, and then one day, he switched to chicken clubs. He could be like that, sometimes, finicky. Temperamental. Those were good years, simple. The diner wasn't doing terribly well, it was all they had: a sizzling griddle, loyal customers, idle walks down the street in the middle of the day when business was slow.

When was that? Two years ago? Five?

Frankie rifled through the receipts, her fingers padding through as though one scrap of paper or the other might contain the answer.

Of course it was not any one scrap of paper, but several of them put together that held the answer. But did it matter, really? What was the difference between two years, and two decades, when it came to something as fleeting as a memory? She would not be able to recover those days, even if she could reconstruct every last detail of that bygone season. Johnny was gone, a walk down Main Street in the middle of the day was no longer all that peaceful. The diner was far too successful; at one point she and Johnny had even talked about opening a second location. But what was the use in that, aside from more headaches?

A man strolled through the park, walking not one, not two, but three dogs. He was supposed to have them on a leash, but they seemed gentle enough. At least until the big golden retriever lumbered up to Frankie, offering to slobber all over her legs and nearly sending the box of receipts flying. He apologized and quickly brought the dog to heel, and Frankie shrugged it off as he slunk off abashedly.

Watching him go, Frankie's eyebrows gathered into a frown. She simply could not let her question rest; she had to know.

It was later that day when she cracked the lid open on her laptop and created a database she called "Johnny's checks." She thought, briefly, about creating a gizmo - or buying one, surely there was a way to buy one - that would read all of his receipts, one by one, and turn them into records for her database. She decided against it out of sheer obstinance; that would take time and she didn't want to bother. She wanted the answer to her question, not another mess of screws and wires on her desk. Once the question entered her mind, she simply couldn't let go of it.

It started out simply enough - typing the receipts into her database, one by one. It was a large enough stack, so it was a simple chore but a long and tedious one. Her fingers ached as she progressed and she had to stretch and walk around more than a few times. What a lot of pain and bother, she thought, for such a simple question, and more than a few times she considered abandoning it. More than a few times, too, she decided that Johnny would have somehow wanted her to stick with it. Or rather, she convinced herself that was true; the man had probably never met a database and almost certainly didn't care very much about them.

She answered the question for herself soon enough - it was three years ago - but forgot it just as quickly. The database took on a life of its own, and she found that she couldn't easily put it out of her mind. What else could she put in it? Other receipts, certainly. Dates, prices, items ordered, of course. Could she remember how her customers felt after each order? The menu items they wanted to order, but didn't? The slices of pie that turned into three or four? She found that she could remember all of that, and she could not stop writing it down.

Frankie worked feverishly for a day, then two. A week went by before she was done and she'd allow herself out of the office. When she finally emerged she felt threadbare. Some giant machine had been spinning and spinning, and could barely stop its own momentum. But she was happy, too - thrilled at having begun something new, at having exhausted everything she had at her disposal. Here, finally, was a comprehensive history of Johnny and his diner - every hash brown and omelette recorded for posterity. It was a tribute, perhaps, a monument to the measured hours and countless days and sleepless nights that had made this place what it was. But what was it?

She gave herself a few minutes in Johnny's favorite booth, a slice stolen from the cross-hatched apple pie on display. Frankie took a bite, then two. Her feet pressed into the ground with a certain shade of melancholy, her fingertips clutched the table top as though it might otherwise slide away. The swirly pattern in the Formica seemed to straighten out, as though it finally made sense. The table had been set for four, the knives and forks neatly arranged. Orderly.

What was she feeling? Was it grief? Nostalgia? A touch of madness? No, not that, none of those. It was something different.

Something complete.

"It's got to be one of the most flexible substances in the world, if you think about it." Cousin Augusta sat across from Frankie in the booth, absently stirring a mug of coffee. She had walked through the door of the diner only a few minutes ago, and already she was getting on Frankie's nerves.

"Look at all the different things you can do with a latte, for starters. You know someone out there is just stuffing an entire chocolate bar in their cup just to see what happens." Augusta measured a couple of sugar packets into her mug at once as though to emphasize the point. "And that's before you think about your savory coffees, with butter or olive oil or who knows what." An arch look from Augusta, and Frankie somehow knew what was coming next. "It's only a matter of time before someone makes a killing off ketchup coffee. What about it, coz? Might as well be this place!"

Frankie did not bother to respond, but wrinkled her nose and pointedly turned her head to look at the display case.

Augusta took the hint and gave her cousin a minute to stew. She picked up the mug and took a loud slurp, then set it down on the table so that the ceramic thumped loudly on the Formica.

"So, this database of yours." Augusta leaned her head to Frankie. "Kind of extraordinary. You digitized all your receipts? Going back how many years now?"

Frankie licked her front teeth with her tongue. "Eighteen. I couldn't find some of the older ones." There was an apologetic tone in her voice.

Augusta smirked in response. "Just eighteen years? I think we can work with that. And you actually know who ordered what? You've got names on these things?"

"How many people do you think live in this town? Until the last couple of years when the tourists started coming through, it was pretty easy. Gus comes in, Johnnie would write his name on the check. Same with Sandra. Same with everyone else. Nothing special." Peevishness crept into Frankie's voice, though she tried to hide it.

It seemed to roll right past Augusta though, who was too busy assessing her plans. "So you've joined your database with the county's right? Vital records, that sort of thing, I assume?"

Frankie's face was a picture of confusion.

"You poor thing, you're new to this game. Here, let me show you." And with that Augusta got up, walked behind the counter, flounced through the swinging double doors next to the grill, and led Frankie into her own office.

Frankie followed Augusta into the office. She closed her eyes and counted to ten in her head, exhaling loudly as she finished. Was Augusta always this condescending? Frankie tried to remember and supposed the answer was a clear and resounding yes. It had been some time since they were together, that was all. Perhaps, in the bargain, there was an extra spring in Augusta's step, a new note of triumph that Frankie had not seen previously. It was more than possible. Johnnie, for all his faults, had never acted this way; if anything he had always found Frankie slightly intimidating.

Augusta was already tapping away at the keyboard. Frankie circled to the cramped space behind the chair in an effort to see what was happening. Her cousin was already deeply enmeshed in her work, apparently downloading something - actually a few somethings.

Frankie sat down in a barely-perceptible huff.

Augusta looked up. "See, by itself your receipts are just... data." She flipped the laptop around as though it would explain anything. "But once you've got someone's name on all those beautiful receipts... well, a lot more is possible. I'm grabbing vital records from the county, then I can join that data to yours. Births, deaths, marriages... you can gauge someone's entire life this way."

Augusta tapped away for a few more minutes in silence. "Wow, you have a lot of repeat customers."

Frankie shrugged. "Most of the old-timers come in every day. There used to be a few that would show up for breakfast and dinner. Not so much anymore, though. Diner got popular, those folks got scarce."

Augusta nodded without paying much attention. "Yeah, I can see that. Way more out of towners over the years. Here, let's pull in the Social Security database, that'll be a lot more matches."

A few more minutes and Augusta was done. "Ok! Let's check it out." She flipped the screen around for Frankie's benefit, showing her a complicated-looking graph.

Frankie wanted badly to tune out Augusta, but she had to admit there was something very compelling about what she was saying. The graph illuminuated the life history of her customers; new children, marriages, and sadly a few deaths. It was a little strange, as though she was seeing the future unfold. She had never thought that much about what happened after her customers walked out the door. They walked in, ordered off the menu, had breakfast, chatted a little, paid the check... and left. That was it. She hadn't quite pictured them walking out the door and having full lives of their own, outside the walls of the diner.

There was something obscene about seeing so many personal details laid out in front of her in this manner, as though she were looking at something not meant for her eyes. Yes, perhaps it was publicly available, but was it really meant for her eyes? She noticed a narrow bar from several years ago; a single birth in one of her customers' families. Frankie realized with a start that the spot on the graph was Gus's granddaughter, whose arrival he announced loudly and proudly to anyone who crossed his path at the time. That was years ago, and now that same granddaughter was a customer who came in with Gus every Sunday.

Augusta was saying something about a model; Frankie had not been paying attention. "It's pretty surprising what you can do with this much data," she concluded.

Frankie shook her head to clear her thoughts. "You want to do what exactly?"

Augusta flipped the screen around and started tapping again. "Build a model. We've got a bunch of receipts from your customers on the one hand, and really good vital records on the other. Now I can see if there's a relationship between what they're ordering in the diner, and what's going on outside the diner. Just a little data magic, that's all."

"You think my omelettes are killing people?" Frankie asked.

"Not quite. More like... the people ordering your omelettes tend to have things happen to them, and there might be a relationship between the one and the other," Augusta replied while tapping away. She looked up for a minute. "Ok. This will take a little while to run. Maybe time for one of those life-changing omelettes?"

Over breakfast Augusta explained her idea a little more fully. With a large and well-annotated data set like Frankie's, she could figure out how orders in the dinner correlated to life events outside it. From that, she could predict how certain orders might be associated with a long and full life.

"You're telling me I can tell someone how long they're going to live based on which breakfast special they pick out?" Frankie speared a potato. She couldn't help but aim a skeptical scowl at Augusta.

Augusta tilted her head to the side and twisted her mouth into a funny half-smirk, as though carefully assessing her cousin. "Maybe not quite that simple. One order isn't quite enough signal by itself. But a bunch of orders strung together? Now that starts to get interesting." Shre drummed the tabletop with her fingertips. "And it's not just life expectancy. Births and marriages are in there too. Kind of interesting, right?"

Frankie considered this word for a moment, weighing it carefully. There was something uncanny in this idea. "I don't know if I'd say 'interesting' exactly. Creepy, maybe? It makes me want to lie down, if I'm telling the truth." She did feel very tired all of a sudden. She glanced around the diner, taking in the handful of regulars and the unfamiliar faces at the same time. Did she really want to know all that much about them? It was one thing to hear about a messy divorce while pouring a cup of coffee, another thing entirely to look it up alongside wedding anniversaries and great-grandchildren.

Augusta, apparently, had not noticed this stream of thought. She had pulled out her laptop and cracked it open, tapping away on the keys. She had not changed much in this way, apparently - Augusta was always ten steps ahead of whoever she was talking to. Maybe she didn't hear what Frankie had said, maybe she hadn't properly taken Frankie's temperature - more likely, she wasn't terribly concerned with the thermometer reading. Momentarily she spun the laptop around so that it faced Frankie. The screen showed a fancy website replete with tablets and other gizmos.

"The first step is to digitize, see? You've got plenty of runway to afford a system like this one. Order it today, we can have your whole shop up-to-date this time next week. You'll never have to dig through paper receipts. again."

Frankie didn't bother to look at the screen; she had a perfectly good notion what Augusta was trying to show her. In truth she'd thought about digitizing her diner before, but there was something nauseating about the picture her cousin was painting. "First step? What exactly do you have in mind as the next step?"

Augusta breathed out heavily through her nose, closed her eyes and counted to ten. It would be a longer conversation then she thought. Her eyes flicked to the clock on the wall. Another hour before the lunch crowd arrived. No need to get too hung up on digitization, that wasn't the real point anyway. Better to get to the point, to show Frankie just how exciting things could get. There was still just enough time to convince her recalcitrant cousin that she could turn this tiny but buzzing little diner into something altogether new.

***

I walked through the door without really thinking about the fact that my sister was on the other side of it. It didn't seem like anything special: some tables, some customers, menus and dishes here and there. A diner like any other. I had been promised something else, by inscrutable text message as always. What did I think I'd find here, after all, a life-changing way of delivering toast and pastries? How many ways are there of delivering carbs to customers? It was a question I didn't have much time to consider, in any case; in a minute I was swept up.
