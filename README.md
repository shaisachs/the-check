# The Check

## 1.

The man had only stopped at the diner because the highway spat him out at the wrong exit. He was traveling alone - midwestern plates, rental-car crumbs, an itinerary that looked self-imposed. The sort of person who orders the day’s special without asking what it is.

Now he sat in his vinyl booth, jacket folded beside him, coffee cooling. When Frankie dropped the check, he glanced at the total, reached for his wallet - then paused.

At the bottom of the receipt, beneath TAX and TOTAL and the small apology about a three-percent card surcharge, there was a final line he had never seen on a diner slip in his life:

**Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.**

He blinked. Read it again.

Raised an eyebrow, the polite midwestern kind that signaled both curiosity and a desire not to make a fuss.

He turned the paper over. The back was blank.

He looked around to see if anyone else had been slipped a cryptic fortune-cookie message disguised as a bill. Everyone else seemed unconcerned. A teenager slurped a milkshake. A pair of construction workers argued amiably about screws. A woman with a laptop typed with collected calm.

The man looked back at the receipt:

**LENORA — Wednesdays.**

He didn’t know a Lenora. He wasn’t even usually in the state.

When Frankie returned with the card machine, he held up the slip between two fingers.

“Uh,” he said, “is this... for me?”

She didn’t even glance at it. “Yep.”

“And - what is it?”

“Just a suggestion,” she said, in the same tone one might use to identify a side salad. “If you want it.”

He didn’t know whether to laugh or to run.

Frankie, meanwhile, was already moving toward the next table, coffee pot in hand.

When she circled back, wiping her hands on her apron, the man gestured her over with the sheepish gravity of someone about to ask something he feared might be obvious to everyone else.

“So,” he said, “this match thing. Is it... I don’t know... some loyalty program?”

Frankie snorted, a tiny, private sound. “No. It’s Augusta’s project.”

“Augusta?”

“My cousin.” A beat. “Visiting for a bit. Very thorough.”

The man looked up at Frankie, as though hopefully expecting more. But she gave hima funny sort of half-frown, as though tasting a creatively-spiced experiment in pasta sauce.

“People say it works,” she added.

“So I’m being set up?”

“Not unless you want to be.” She poured him more coffee without asking. “You can ignore it. Most folks do. Or pretend to.”

No inclination to explain further. She was already pivoting to greet a regular who’d slipped in behind him.

The man looked again at the slip of paper lying innocently beside his saucer. As if it had printed itself merely to pass the time.

He peered carefully at the other diners. Perhaps there was something they knew that he didn't.

At the counter, the teenager with the milkshake picked up her receipt, read it, and grinned.

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

She snapped a picture and sent it to someone with the speed of long practice.

Near the window, one of the construction workers read his own line: “Jogging partner.” He groaned theatrically. “I don’t jog,” he protested to no one in particular. The other worker clapped him on the back and said, “That’s why it’s a suggestion.”

At the far end, the laptop woman slid her bill under her palm:

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”

She blinked, once, a short laugh escaping her, like a note struck by accident.

// todo: fix the "or resigned.."
Nobody seemed confused by any of it. Mildly entertained, perhaps. Or accustomed, the way one becomes accustomed to the hiccups of the everyday: the one stoplight that never times right, the one neighbor who leaves zucchini on everyone’s porch.

The suggestions were strange — too specific to be meaningless, too gentle to be intrusive. They hovered between the absurd and the oddly insightful, like the diner somehow knew more about its patrons than they knew about themselves.

The man folded his slip and tucked it into his wallet. For later, he told himself, though he wasn’t sure what “later” meant.

The receipt printer behind the counter whirred, sputtered, then spat out another check as though clearing its throat. The sound carried a faint sense of deliberation. Frankie didn’t touch it. No one had pressed a button. The machine worked in its own rhythm: pauses that felt contemplative, followed by little bursts of decisiveness. Like someone muttering to themselves while solving a crossword.

The overhead lights hummed with a soft warmth, flickering not in the way of old fixtures but in a way that suggested attention — like they brightened half a shade whenever someone laughed, dimmed gently when a conversation turned private. The griddle’s low sizzle blended with the refrigerator’s steady breath, creating an odd harmony, a domestic heartbeat under the mundane noise.

The man watched as the printer finished with a theatrical final twitch - almost a flourish - and Frankie tore the paper free. She set it on a couple's table without ceremony. Neither diner looked surprised when they read the line at the bottom. They nodded once, like the match was something they’d expected.

Maybe everyone here had grown accustomed to the diner’s small murmurs of insight. Maybe nobody questioned where the suggestions came from because the explanation, if it existed, was less interesting than the matches.

The man lingered by the door for a moment, listening. The whole place seemed to exhale, a soft release of air that wasn’t mechanical so much as communal - an organism settling back into its posture after being briefly observed.

Outside, the highway roared indifferently. Here, something else was happening. Something quiet. Something that behaved as though checks had a pulse.

He stepped into the sunlight, receipt tucked securely in his wallet, the line about **LENORA — Wednesdays** repeating in the back of his mind like a tune he hadn’t meant to memorize.

## 2.

It was some time ago that the diner closed for an afternoon -  an event rare enough that locals might have taken pictures if they’d passed by. But they knew better than that. The handwritten sign on the door, *BE BACK TOMORROW — PROBABLY*, fluttered whenever a car whooshed past. The windows reflected a pale winter sun, giving the whole place the appearance of napping.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of bleach and lemon oil, as though Frankie had attempted a perfunctory cleaning before admitting defeat. The lights were set to half, casting long, slow shadows across the checkered floor.

Augusta stood in the aisle like an explorer surveying ruins. Her hair was shoved into a bun that had clearly been negotiated rather than styled. She wore a sweater with sleeves pushed past her elbows and a look of delighted overwhelm.

“I swear it wasn’t always such a mess,” Frankie muttered as she tried to shove a dolly - laden with boxes of mysterious provenance - toward the storage room.

Augusta smiled without teasing. “That’s because there was a system.”

“That’s generous,” Frankie returned.

The boxes were stacked in erratic towers, some leaning like they were tired of holding themselves up. A crate labeled *MYSTERY LIDS* sat atop a box labeled *EXTRA STRAWS (WHY SO MANY?)*.

Frankie bent to pick up a fallen dish towel. Augusta picked up a stack of menus, flipping through them as if they might contain secrets.

“Why do you have four versions of the breakfast menu?” Augusta asked.

“We kept redesigning it,” Frankie said. “But every time we printed a new draft, someone would complain the font looked funny.”

They laughed quietly together - an easy, shared rhythm that made the task feel more manageable.

Outside, the sound of snowmelt tapping onto a metal bucket offered a slow, rhythmic accompaniment.

The diner hummed—a low, collective murmur of refrigerators, lights, and vents—as though it were listening in.

Frankie braced herself and shouldered the storage room door open. It resisted with the stubbornness of a place that had been neglected long enough to develop opinions. When it finally gave way, something inside shifted with a soft *shfff*, and a box slid out, thumping against her boot.

“Oh no,” she said.

Augusta peeked over her shoulder and let out a low whistle.

The room was a chaos of cardboard: towers that leaned precariously, narrow passages between stacks, labels written in elegant handwriting - every letter precise, elegant, and a touch theatrical.

Augusta crouched. “Let’s see. Receipts A-C, 1998–2002.” She checked another. “Pie Orders, 1998.”

She scanned the wall of boxes. “Do these boxes contain... everything?”

Frankie sat on the floor in response. Cross-legged.

Augusta lifted the lid of a box, releasing a dusty breath that smelled faintly of old paper and cinnamon. Inside were bundles of receipts tied with red-and-white baker’s twine. Each bundle had annotations: little circles around menu items, arrows between orders, tiny notes like *ask about her sister*, *same order every Thursday*, *avoid seating them near table 2 - acoustic issues?*.

“You have an archive,” Augusta whispered.

Frankie’s groan was half-embarrassment, half-affection.

Augusta pulled one bundle free and set it on the counter like it was fragile. The handwriting curled in soft loops along the margins. Each slip felt like a miniature diary entry from someone who had always noticed more than he let on.

The dining room felt suddenly smaller, or maybe warmer—memory pressing in without suffocating.

The next morning, Augusta arrived with a flatbed scanner that looked suspiciously fresh for something she claimed to have “borrowed.” It took up half the counter, its cord snake-trailing behind the pie display.

“Please tell me you’re not scanning *all* of it,” Frankie said, pouring herself a coffee.

“Not today,” Augusta said. “But soon. Paper fades. Memories too. Might as well save what we can.”

She set to work with clinical enthusiasm: lift a receipt, flatten it gently, press the lid of the scanner closed, tap the keyboard with a flourish. The machine hummed with a steady, patient rhythm.

Frankie watched her for a while, then wandered off to reorganize the tea shelf-a task she’d been avoiding for months. Every few minutes, the soft whir of the scanner drifted through the diner, creating a kind of irregular heartbeat.

“You know these aren’t historically important,” Frankie said eventually.

Augusta held up a receipt with a swirl of arrows and a note that said *ask about the dog park—he’ll appreciate it*.

“This check is history,” she said. “Just not the kind museums know how to display.”

Frankie didn’t answer. Wordlessly she set out two slices of pie.

The receipt printer across the room whirred once, abruptly, as if clearing its throat.

Augusta glanced over. “Do your appliances normally talk to each other?”

Frankie shrugged. “They’ve got opinions.”

***

It happened on a Tuesday. Of course it was a Tuesday.

Augusta had scanned thousands of receipts by then, feeding them into a simple indexing program she wrote to categorize dates, patrons, orders, and any scribbled observations. The program was basic - just enough to filter and search.

Except it wasn’t behaving like a basic program.

She searched a name to test something and the program suggested three others who were frequent booth-sharing companions. Except she hadn't asked it to. And none of their checks indicated anything about booth-sharing.

“Odd,” Augusta murmured.

She ran another query. The result flickered, then expanded into a cluster none of her logic accounted for.

“Frankie,” she called. “Your receipts are doing something weird.”

Before Frankie could ask what “weird” meant, the receipt printer sputtered and spat out a slip.

Frankie glanced instinctively over her shoulder. “Did you print something?”

“No,” Augusta said.

Frankie crossed the room. The slip read:

**You should ask her about Thursdays.**

“Her who?” Frankie asked.

The printer whirred again and produced a second slip.

It contained a single comma.

A perfectly centered, unassuming comma.

Augusta stared. “Okay. Now it’s definitely weird.”

The diner hummed around them, unbothered - as though it had simply added a new sound to its ambient repertoire.

Frankie went back to the griddle, muttering, “Not dealing with that thing today.”

Augusta kept watching the printer like it might continue speaking.

***

The first photo of a "suggestion receipt" appeared online courtesy of a tourist who’d stopped in for an omelet. Her slip read:
**Suggested collaborator for your quilt project.**

She posted it with three laughing emojis and the caption: *this diner is legit*, and the internet, being the internet, latched on.
x
Within days, the diner saw an uptick in customers - curious locals, intrigued travelers, people who claimed they “just happened to be passing through” despite having license plates from two states over.

The suggestions varied wildly: **Try the farmers’ market at dawn. You’ll meet him there.**; **Knitters’ circle—Mondays. Bring snacks.**; **Volunteer for the creek cleanup. You’ll like who shows up.**; **Ask about the lemon bars recipe. Trust us.**

A pair of retirees found a shared hobby after their receipts nudged them toward the same birdwatching group. A teenager discovered a friend who loved the same obscure space opera series. A pair of musicians realized they’d both been writing songs alone and started meeting on Thursdays.

People lingered longer. Conversations stretched. Laughter became more frequent, softer but richer.

A journalist came through and described the place as “an oracle disguised as a grill.” Frankie snorted through her nose when she read it but clipped the article and stuck it to the fridge.

The printer chugged along unbothered, offering its suggestions without fanfare. Frankie and Augusta didn’t try to explain it. They didn’t really want to.

It was enough that people kept finding each other.

## 3.

By late morning the office had developed the familiar shimmer of another high-reassignment day. Mathi noticed it first in the project dashboard: three reshuffles before 10 a.m., each accompanied by the same apologetic notification — We’re optimizing for flow… thank you for your patience! — which only made it worse. Optimizing for flow never felt like flow.

At 10:47 the dashboard blinked, refreshed a fourth time, and unassigned her from a task she’d begun precisely seven minutes earlier. She stared at the blank space where the task had been. Her cursor hovered in a way that made her feel like she might be reassigned if she didn’t get up. So she did.

Two floors down, Alma closed out of a meeting-before-the-meeting that had somehow reappeared on her schedule after she’d canceled it. The icon pulsed faintly, insisting. The moment she ended the call for the second time that morning, the same meeting—same participants, same agenda—repopulated for the following week. She stared at it, sighed audibly, and pushed her chair back. Her body rose before her brain did. Lunch, she thought. Now.

They didn’t coordinate their exit, but their badges logged out within thirty seconds of each other. The turnstile chirped twice, halfheartedly.

Outside, the sun was unreasonably bright for a weekday, which felt like another misalignment. The small park across from the office — a strip of lawn and seven city-approved trees — shimmered with early-afternoon warmth. It had always been a refuge for employees looking for something not lit by LEDs. Mathi crossed the street toward it with the air of someone fleeing a fire that wasn’t technically a fire. Alma walked with the same urgency from the opposite direction.

They arrived at the same tree without noticing the coincidence. It was the one tree everyone preferred: the only one whose shade was broad enough to sit under without choosing between sunburn and damp grass. Mathi sat first, unwrapping her lunch. Alma was still scanning the small slope of the park when she realized someone else had claimed the spot. For a moment she considered choosing another tree, but the others were taken by a group from accounting.

So she approached the occupied tree with a polite, uncertain wave.
“Mind if I—?”

Mathi looked up, startled, then relieved. “Please,” she said. “I was starting to feel weird eating alone today.”

Alma smiled, but her eyes carried the same feeling. She lowered herself to the grass, set her lunch beside her, and only after a long breath did they both realize they had the same compostable clamshell box.

Mathi blinked. “Huh. You get the eggplant too?”

“Yeah,” Alma said. “I didn’t even want eggplant. I just… ordered it.”

They opened their containers at the same moment. Identical. Even the pickled onions were arranged in the same neat crescent along the edge. Alma fished around for her receipt. Mathi did the same. When the two slips of paper were laid side by side, they shared the exact same timestamp — down to the second.

“That’s…” Mathi began.

“A coincidence,” Alma said quickly, but her tone was too firm. “A weird one. That’s all.”

Mathi nodded, though she didn’t believe it. The gentle breeze felt scripted. The birds sounded overdubbed. For a few minutes they ate in silence, both pretending the strangeness wasn’t folding itself gently around them.

Eventually Alma said, “Did your dashboard reshuffle today?”

“Four times before eleven.”

“Three for me. It feels like someone’s shuffling cards too fast.”

“Or too confidently.”

“That too.”

A drone buzzed overhead — the small kind used for individual lunch deliveries. They usually passed through the park on their way to the company tower, but this one slowed as it approached the tree. It hovered for a full, evaluative second above their heads, then drifted toward a man on a bench a few yards away. The bag released cleanly into his hands. The drone hesitated once more before zipping off.

Mathi watched it leave. “Maybe we’re being reassigned as friends.”

“I’m at capacity,” Alma said, deadpan.

Mathi snorted in laughter. It wasn’t a big laugh — more the kind that spilled out when tension had nowhere else to go. Alma pressed her lips together to hide her own smile.

They ate the rest of their identical lunches under the shade of the tree. The breeze settled. The shimmer of the morning drifted, slightly, back into alignment. But not fully. Not enough for either of them to call the moment normal.

When they finally stood to return to work, their receipts fluttered in the grass for a moment before being pinned by the same sudden gust of wind — the timing so eerily aligned that they both froze, watching the slips of paper lie there side by side, twins again.

Alma exhaled. “Okay,” she said. “That one wasn’t nothing.”

Mathi nodded. “No. It wasn’t.”

They left the park together, not walking in step, but close enough to notice when they briefly were.

## 4.

The diner was in one of its long, honey-colored hours, the kind that seemed to stretch time rather than pass through it. Sunlight slanted in at an angle that made every chrome surface glow. The air held that particular late-afternoon softness - like the inside of a seashell - where sound pooled but didn’t echo.

Mathi and Alma had taken the booth beneath the large front window, the one where the blinds were always slightly crooked. Their screens glowed with green pins, soil moisture readings, volunteer sign-up notes, growing-season projections. It had begun as a small idea - something they’d joked about - and now it was quietly gathering form. The map had a living quality. The cluster of green markers felt like seedlings pushing up through digital soil. Where the pins thickened, it gave the impression of vines exploring new terrain. Where they thinned, it looked like a trellis waiting for someone to train a branch along it.

Frankie approached.

“Your forest’s getting bigger,” she said, studying the screen.

“It’s not a forest yet,” Alma replied.

“Well, it looks like it wants to be,” Frankie said, which somehow mattered.

The receipt printer at the counter produced a new slip for a trio of students hunched over milkshakes and textbooks. They giggled at whatever had been suggested, exchanging looks of conspiratorial delight.

The diner was in a benevolent mood that day - watchful, patient, amused by the world finding its way.

Mathi noticed a small patch of paint on the far wall he’d never really looked at before - a tiny chipped area revealing older colors underneath. Peach beneath cream, beneath an even older shade of dusty blue. The place was layered, lived-in, accumulated. Like tree rings that didn’t bother arranging themselves into tidy circles.

He exhaled. His whole body softened.

// todo: might be a little too suggestive
Alma nudged him gently with her knee, wordlessly asking if he was okay.

He gave her the half-smile reserved for people who already understand the answer.

They worked in a silence that wasn’t empty. It felt more like the silence of a garden: the quiet that’s full of small, earnest activity.

Alma’s phone buzzed once. She lifted it, read, and tilted the screen toward him.

The headline read like a parody of itself: **SYSTEMIC ALIGNMENT PROJECT SHIFTING TO STRATEGIC PIVOT.**

Mathi barked an incredulous laugh. “That’s one way to put it.”

He skimmed the article. Phrases leapt out at him: *behavioral adjacency misfires*, *unintended redeployment spirals*, *role dissolution events*, *compatibility misinterpretation*.

// todo: too blunt
He winced. The language felt like someone describing a broken relationship using only engineering terms.

“They never say what actually happened,” he murmured.

“They won’t,” Alma said. She spooned some foam from her tea and let it dissolve again. “Wall Street admits collapse the way people admit heartbreak. With a rebound.”

He glanced around the diner. A teenager in a letterman jacket was showing his grandmother how to use a QR code. A pair of paramedics shared pancakes after a long shift. A man in a paint-splattered hoodie sketched ideas on the back of a placemat.

“That place feels like an ancient memory,” he said.

“Good riddance,” Alma replied.

Their shoulders relaxed at the same time.

The kitchen door swung open with a soft thump, and Augusta appeared balancing a tower of clean glasses in one arm, an unruly pile of sketches under another. She always looked like she was listening - to the building, to the customers, to the quiet logic of how people move when they’re not pretending.

She paused when she saw Mathi and Alma bent over their project.

// todo: too much 'up to something' here
“You two look like you’re up to something,” she said.

“We are,” Alma said, not looking up from her screen.

Frankie emerged with a box of napkins tucked under her arm. She set it down with a sigh, then froze when she saw Augusta's pile.

“Ugh,” Frankie said. “Are you thinking of expanding again?”

Augusta blinked with exaggerated innocence. “I’m only sketching. Sketching isn’t expanding.”

“It’s pre-expanding,” Frankie said.

Mathi stirred. “What's going on?”

Frankie and Augusta exchanged a glance that was hard to decipher - half deflection, half excitement.

“Nothing,” Frankie said.

“Something,” Augusta corrected archly.

The sketches were subtle: schematic lines, penciled notes about windows, arrows pointing to imagined breezeways. No two drawings looked alike. One showed a long, narrow café tucked beside a laundromat. Another depicted a sunlit room with a single communal table. A third had a rooftop patio full of potted citrus trees.

Frankie tapped the notepad. “People keep asking us how the printer works. Whether we could start another place somewhere. But this diner is... this diner.”

“It doesn’t want to be duplicated,” Augusta said.

“But maybe,” Frankie said slowly, “there’s such a thing as cousins.”

Mathi felt something expand in the air. Not ambition. Not empire. More like branches - stretching outward at their own pace, following the light.

Augusta pulled out the sketch at the bottom of the pile - a drawing of a building that resembled the diner if you squinted, but the details were different. More plants. Wider windows. A porch meant for lingering.

“I think of it like a network,” she said, making a face at the word. “But that's not quite right.”

Frankie glared. “If anyone suggests a franchise model, I’ll throw their pancakes out the window.”

Augusta tapped the drawing again. “I’m thinking about places that know each other. Places that hear the same wind. Like trees in a grove. They don’t match, but they rhyme.”

Mathi nodded slowly. “Like how a root system isn’t organized the way people want it to be.”

“Yes!” Augusta said. “Messy on paper, perfect in practice.”

// todo: ugh
“There’s a kind of wisdom in it,” Alma said. “A quiet one.”

Augusta’s eyes sparkled. “Not instructions. Not predictions. Just... noticing. And offering.”

“This sketch feels like it wants to exist,” Alma said.

Frankie rolled her eyes, shrugged. “If it starts printing me blueprints, I’m quitting.”

From the counter, the receipt printer whirred softly, almost teasing.

***

They had soup for dinner - miso for Alma, lentil curry for Mathi.

Frankie left their check face down on the table, a casual gesture. Mathi reached for it, more out of habit than anything, but paused when he turned it over.

The numbers were there - subtotal, tax, a polite space for tip. But at the bottom, tucked almost shyly into the lower margin, were two words printed in the smallest font the machine could manage:

// todo: kind of hate this
**good team**
