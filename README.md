# The Check

## 1.

The man had only stopped at the diner because the highway spat him out at the wrong exit. He was traveling alone - midwestern plates, rental-car crumbs, an itinerary that looked self-imposed. The sort of person who orders the day’s special without asking what it is.

Now he sat in his vinyl booth, jacket folded beside him, coffee cooling. When Frankie dropped the check, he glanced at the total, reached for his wallet - then paused.

At the bottom of the receipt, beneath TAX and TOTAL and the small apology about a three-percent card surcharge, there was a final line he had never seen on a diner slip in his life:

**Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.**

He blinked. Read it again.

Raised an eyebrow, the polite midwestern kind that signaled both curiosity and a desire not to make a fuss.

He turned the paper over. The back was blank.

He looked around to see if anyone else had been slipped a cryptic fortune-cookie message disguised as a bill. Everyone else seemed unconcerned. A teenager slurped a milkshake. A pair of construction workers argued amiably about screws. A woman with a laptop typed with collected calm.

The man looked back at the receipt:

**LENORA — Wednesdays.**

He didn’t know a Lenora. He wasn’t even usually in the state.

When Frankie returned with the card machine, he held up the slip between two fingers.

“Uh,” he said, “is this... for me?”

She didn’t even glance at it. “Yep.”

“And - what is it?”

“Just a suggestion,” she said, in the same tone one might use to identify a side salad. “If you want it.”

He didn’t know whether to laugh or to run.

Frankie, meanwhile, was already moving toward the next table, coffee pot in hand.

When she circled back, wiping her hands on her apron, the man gestured her over with the sheepish gravity of someone about to ask something he feared might be obvious to everyone else.

“So,” he said, “this match thing. Is it... I don’t know... some loyalty program?”

Frankie snorted, a tiny, private sound. “No. It’s Augusta’s project.”

“Augusta?”

“My cousin.” A beat. “Visiting for a bit. Very thorough.”

The man looked up at Frankie, as though hopefully expecting more. But she gave hima funny sort of half-frown, as though tasting a creatively-spiced experiment in pasta sauce.

“People say it works,” she added.

“So I’m being set up?”

“Not unless you want to be.” She poured him more coffee without asking. “You can ignore it. Most folks do. Or pretend to.”

No inclination to explain further. She was already pivoting to greet a regular who’d slipped in behind him.

The man looked again at the slip of paper lying innocently beside his saucer. As if it had printed itself merely to pass the time.

He peered carefully at the other diners. Perhaps there was something they knew that he didn't.

At the counter, the teenager with the milkshake picked up her receipt, read it, and grinned.

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

She snapped a picture and sent it to someone with the speed of long practice.

Near the window, one of the construction workers read his own line: “Jogging partner.” He groaned theatrically. “I don’t jog,” he protested to no one in particular. The other worker clapped him on the back and said, “That’s why it’s a suggestion.”

At the far end, the laptop woman slid her bill under her palm:

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”

She blinked, once, a short laugh escaping her, like a note struck by accident.

Nobody seemed confused by any of it. Mildly entertained, perhaps. Or accustomed, the way one becomes accustomed to a stoplight that never times right.

The suggestions were strange — too specific to be meaningless, too gentle to be intrusive. They hovered between the absurd and the oddly insightful, like the diner somehow knew more about its patrons than they knew about themselves.

The man folded his slip and tucked it into his wallet. For later, he told himself, though he wasn’t sure what “later” meant.

The receipt printer behind the counter whirred, sputtered, then spat out another check as though clearing its throat. The sound carried a faint sense of deliberation. Frankie didn’t touch it. No one had pressed a button. The machine worked in its own rhythm: pauses that felt contemplative, followed by little bursts of decisiveness. Like someone muttering to themselves while solving a crossword.

The overhead lights hummed with a soft warmth, flickering not in the way of old fixtures but in a way that suggested attention — like they brightened half a shade whenever someone laughed, dimmed gently when a conversation turned private. The griddle’s low sizzle blended with the refrigerator’s steady breath, creating an odd harmony, a domestic heartbeat under the mundane noise.

The man watched as the printer finished with a theatrical final twitch - almost a flourish - and Frankie tore the paper free. She set it on a couple's table without ceremony. Neither diner looked surprised when they read the line at the bottom. They nodded once, like the match was something they’d expected.

Maybe everyone here had grown accustomed to the diner’s small murmurs of insight. Maybe nobody questioned where the suggestions came from because the explanation, if it existed, was less interesting than the matches.

The man lingered by the door for a moment, listening. The whole place seemed to exhale, a soft release of air that wasn’t mechanical so much as communal - an organism settling back into its posture after being briefly observed.

Outside, the highway roared indifferently. Here, something else was happening. Something quiet. Something that behaved as though checks had a pulse.

He stepped into the sunlight, receipt tucked securely in his wallet, the line about **LENORA — Wednesdays** repeating in the back of his mind like a tune he hadn’t meant to memorize.

## 2.

It was some time ago that the diner closed for an afternoon -  an event rare enough that locals might have taken pictures if they’d passed by. But they knew better than that. The handwritten sign on the door, *BE BACK TOMORROW — PROBABLY*, fluttered whenever a car whooshed past. The windows reflected a pale winter sun, giving the whole place the appearance of napping.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of bleach and lemon oil, as though Frankie had attempted a perfunctory cleaning before admitting defeat. The lights were set to half, casting long, slow shadows across the checkered floor.

Augusta stood in the aisle like an explorer surveying ruins. Her hair was shoved into a bun that had clearly been negotiated rather than styled. She wore a sweater with sleeves pushed past her elbows and a look of delighted overwhelm.

“I swear it wasn’t always such a mess,” Frankie muttered as she tried to shove a dolly - laden with boxes of mysterious provenance - toward the storage room.

Augusta smiled without teasing. “That’s because there was a system.”

“That’s generous,” Frankie returned.

The boxes were stacked in erratic towers, some leaning like they were tired of holding themselves up. A crate labeled *MYSTERY LIDS* sat atop a box labeled *EXTRA STRAWS (WHY SO MANY?)*.

Frankie bent to pick up a fallen dish towel. Augusta picked up a stack of menus, flipping through them as if they might contain secrets.

“Why do you have four versions of the breakfast menu?” Augusta asked.

“We kept redesigning it,” Frankie said. “But every time we printed a new draft, someone would complain the font looked funny.”

They laughed quietly together - an easy, shared rhythm that made the task feel more manageable.

Outside, the sound of snowmelt tapping onto a metal bucket offered a slow, rhythmic accompaniment.

The diner hummed—a low, collective murmur of refrigerators, lights, and vents—as though it were listening in.

Frankie braced herself and shouldered the storage room door open. It resisted with the stubbornness of a place that had been neglected long enough to develop opinions. When it finally gave way, something inside shifted with a soft *shfff*, and a box slid out, thumping against her boot.

“Oh no,” she said.

Augusta peeked over her shoulder and let out a low whistle.

The room was a chaos of cardboard: towers that leaned precariously, narrow passages between stacks, labels written in elegant handwriting - every letter precise, elegant, and a touch theatrical.

Augusta crouched. “Let’s see. Receipts A-C, 1998–2002.” She checked another. “Pie Orders, 1998.”

She scanned the wall of boxes. “Do these boxes contain... everything?”

Frankie sat on the floor in response. Cross-legged.

Augusta lifted the lid of a box, releasing a dusty breath that smelled faintly of old paper and cinnamon. Inside were bundles of receipts tied with red-and-white baker’s twine. Each bundle had annotations: little circles around menu items, arrows between orders, tiny notes like *ask about her sister*, *same order every Thursday*, *avoid seating them near table 2 - acoustic issues?*.

“You have an archive,” Augusta whispered.

Frankie’s groan was half-embarrassment, half-affection.

Augusta pulled one bundle free and set it on the counter like it was fragile. The handwriting curled in soft loops along the margins. Each slip felt like a miniature diary entry from someone who had always noticed more than he let on.

The dining room felt suddenly smaller, or maybe warmer—memory pressing in without suffocating.

The next morning, Augusta arrived with a flatbed scanner that looked suspiciously fresh for something she claimed to have “borrowed.” It took up half the counter, its cord snake-trailing behind the pie display.

“Please tell me you’re not scanning *all* of it,” Frankie said, pouring herself a coffee.

“Not today,” Augusta said. “But soon. Paper fades. Memories too. Might as well save what we can.”

She set to work with clinical enthusiasm: lift a receipt, flatten it gently, press the lid of the scanner closed, tap the keyboard with a flourish. The machine hummed with a steady, patient rhythm.

Frankie watched her for a while, then wandered off to reorganize the tea shelf-a task she’d been avoiding for months. Every few minutes, the soft whir of the scanner drifted through the diner, creating a kind of irregular heartbeat.

“You know these aren’t historically important,” Frankie said eventually.

Augusta held up a receipt with a swirl of arrows and a note that said *ask about the dog park—he’ll appreciate it*.

“This check is history,” she said. “Just not the kind museums know how to display.”

Frankie didn’t answer. Wordlessly she set out two slices of pie.

The receipt printer across the room whirred once, abruptly, as if clearing its throat.

Augusta glanced over. “Do your appliances normally talk to each other?”

Frankie shrugged. “They’ve got opinions.”

***

It happened on a Tuesday. Of course it was a Tuesday.

Augusta had scanned thousands of receipts by then, feeding them into a simple indexing program she wrote to categorize dates, patrons, orders, and any scribbled observations. The program was basic - just enough to filter and search.

Except it wasn’t behaving like a basic program.

She searched a name to test something and the program suggested three others who were frequent booth-sharing companions. Except she hadn't asked it to. And none of their checks indicated anything about booth-sharing.

“Odd,” Augusta murmured.

She ran another query. The result flickered, then expanded into a cluster none of her logic accounted for.

“Frankie,” she called. “Your receipts are doing something weird.”

Before Frankie could ask what “weird” meant, the receipt printer sputtered and spat out a slip.

Frankie glanced instinctively over her shoulder. “Did you print something?”

“No,” Augusta said.

Frankie crossed the room. The slip read:

**You should ask her about Thursdays.**

“Her who?” Frankie asked.

The printer whirred again and produced a second slip.

It contained a single comma.

A perfectly centered, unassuming comma.

Augusta stared. “Okay. Now it’s definitely weird.”

The diner hummed around them, unbothered - as though it had simply added a new sound to its ambient repertoire.

Frankie went back to the griddle, muttering, “Not dealing with that thing today.”

Augusta kept watching the printer like it might continue speaking.

***

The first photo of a "suggestion receipt" appeared online courtesy of a tourist who’d stopped in for an omelet. Her slip read:
**Suggested collaborator for your quilt project.**

She posted it with three laughing emojis and the caption: *this diner is legit*, and the internet, being the internet, latched on.
x
Within days, the diner saw an uptick in customers - curious locals, intrigued travelers, people who claimed they “just happened to be passing through” despite having license plates from two states over.

The suggestions varied wildly: **Try the farmers’ market at dawn. You’ll meet him there.**; **Knitters’ circle—Mondays. Bring snacks.**; **Volunteer for the creek cleanup. You’ll like who shows up.**; **Ask about the lemon bars recipe. Trust us.**

A pair of retirees found a shared hobby after their receipts nudged them toward the same birdwatching group. A teenager discovered a friend who loved the same obscure space opera series. A pair of musicians realized they’d both been writing songs alone and started meeting on Thursdays.

People lingered longer. Conversations stretched. Laughter became more frequent, softer but richer.

A journalist came through and described the place as “an oracle disguised as a grill.” Frankie snorted through her nose when she read it but clipped the article and stuck it to the fridge.

The printer chugged along unbothered, offering its suggestions without fanfare. Frankie and Augusta didn’t try to explain it. They didn’t really want to.

It was enough that people kept finding each other.

## 3.

Mathi arrived at his desk with the calm resignation of a man who knows exactly what the day portends. He set down his bag, opened his terminal, and began reading through a half-written onboarding document he could have sworn he’d finished yesterday. The system had reassigned him as the “documentation lead” for something called the Branch Ledger Integration Initiative, which he’d never heard of, and which bore no relation to the biodiversity project he’d been working on last week.

He clicked through the project’s page. Three names appeared under “Team Members”: his own, someone named J. Patel, and someone named Weatherford (temp). Weatherford had no first name and no profile picture, which was a bad sign. Temporary assignments tended to vanish mid-sentence.

A minute later the names blinked, refreshed, and rearranged themselves.

Suddenly he was part of a two-person emergency analysis team on a completely different project - Hyperlocal Routing Optimization, Pilot Region 7. A project tagged ARCHIVED. His teammate was listed as McSomething—the system truncated the rest.

The absurdity wasn’t even the project. It was that the system had paired him with a delivery fleet specialist to do geo-statistical forecasting, which was neither of their fields.

Someone walked behind him and muttered, “Oh, come on.”

Mathi refreshed his dashboard. It reshuffled again. His new teammate was now a graphics designer from a different floor.

He closed the tab.

There was no point trying to work until the system finished its spasms. And despite the cheerful “Your optimal team is forming!” banner bouncing on his screen, it was clear the system was having a confused morning.

He stood, stretched his back, and made a quiet decision to step outside.

One floor above, Alma was having a similar morning.

Her reassignment had begun subtly: a single unexpected meeting invite, then a shift in her “role emphasis,” then a complete erasure of her usual task queue.

Her new assignments made no sense. She had been moved into a “partnership incubation pod” with: a materials engineer, a copywriter, and a former horticultural intern she vaguely remembered seeing in the elevator once. His profile listed his current role as “floating.”

They were supposed to pitch something on Monday.

“What something?” Alma had typed into the team channel.

No one replied.

Her fingers hovered over her keyboard. She tried drafting a message clarifying that she was actually part of Civic Data Coordination, and perhaps there had been a mix-up. Before she could hit send, her entire assignment block vanished and was replaced with a meeting notification titled “Reassurance Touchpoint: Maintaining Stability During Fluid Allocation Cycles.”

Alma stared at the title.

“No,” she told her computer. “Absolutely not.”

She closed the meeting. It reappeared. She deleted it again. It reappeared, glibly undeterred.

She took the hint.

She grabbed her bag - she always kept it ready for “organizational liquidity emergencies,” a term invented two reorganizations ago - and walked straight out of the building.

Outside, blue sky. Clear light. A warmth that surprised her.

The park two blocks away drew her like a magnet. Mostly because of the trees. One tree in particular.

It wasn’t a big park, nor particularly lovely by any urban-planner standards. But Alma had found early on that she preferred it to the company courtyard with its carefully curated seating pods. The park had grass that sometimes grew unevenly, and trees that weren’t pruned to uniform silhouettes. It had birds that did not respect boundaries. And it had the seventh tree - the one slightly off-center from the path, with a canopy wide enough to subdue even the sharpest midday sun.

She crossed the street toward it.

Mathi reached the tree first. He could feel the ground soften beneath his steps as he approached. This tree was an old companion of his midday escapes.

He sat in the grass without ceremony. The shade wrapped around him, uneven but sincere.

He opened his lunch.

He never ate the same lunch twice in a row. Not on principle, but out of curiosity. Sometimes he chose at random. Sometimes he selected the “chef’s special,” even if the chef changed weekly. Sometimes he wandered into a new place because someone leaving it had looked happy.

Today he had brought a salad with roasted squash and fennel from a small shop he had not visited before. The dressing was in a little lidded container, which pleased him. Control over dressing was important.

He had just finished shaking it open when he noticed someone else approaching the tree.

Alma hesitated for half a second, long enough for him to recognize that she, too, was deciding whether the tree could accommodate two.

He gestured lightly. “There’s plenty of space.”

“Oh, thanks,” she said, sitting down on the opposite side of the trunk’s central shadow. “It’s my favorite one.”

“Mine too.”

There was a pause as the two settled into the shade.

Alma set down her lunch, still closed. She took a deep breath, letting the air out slowly.

“Rough morning?” Mathi asked.

“Chaotic,” she said. “Yourself?”

He laughed under his breath. “Not chaotic so much as... scrambled. Like the system picked up the office and shook it.”

“That’s exactly what it felt like.”

She finally opened her lunch, revealing a dish that looked nothing like his: something with noodles and lime wedges, bright and aromatic.

Mathi nodded at it. “Good choice.”

“I hope so. I’ve never had this one before.”

He smiled. “Same. I like trying something new every day. Lunch is the one thing I don’t want to automate.”

“Exactly!” Alma said, animated suddenly. “Everyone keeps telling me to just set a default order so I don’t have to think about it. But I like thinking about it. It’s such a small decision, but it actually changes my day.”

Mathi brightened. “And you get to find out what the city tastes like.”

“Yes!” She grinned. “Precisely.”

They ate for a bit in comfortable quiet.

Around them the park hummed along in its usual patchy harmony - traffic muffled by distance, children laughing too loudly from somewhere near the fountain, birds competing for scraps on the path. The wind moved the leaves of the seventh tree in soft, intermittent breaths, shading first Mathi, then Alma, then both at once.

After a while, Alma wiped her mouth with a napkin and asked, “Did you get reassigned to a bunch of teams that made no sense today?”

Mathi swallowed a bite of squash. “Oh yeah. I had a horticultural intern and a drone pilot in my queue for about ten minutes. We were supposed to build a predictive model for long-distance freight routes.”

Alma smirked. “I got put in a pitch team with a materials engineer. The meeting title said something about ‘cross-domain ideation.’”

“Did it tell you what you were ideating?”

“No.”

“That sounds right.”

“You?”

“A pilot region routing initiative.”

“Do you know anything about routing?”

“No.”

She laughed, full and unrestrained. “It’s like the system is desperately trying to pair people who shouldn’t be paired.”

“Maybe it’s going through something,” Mathi said dryly.

Alma nodded solemnly. “A growth phase.”

“A developmental leap.”

“An identity crisis.”

They laughed together, the feeling light and real.

The conversation drifted naturally. Mathi waxed poetic about a kebab place he had found a week ago. Unreal garlic sauce. Alma confessed she had an urge to rearrange her entire apartment every few months just to see if it changed how she thought.

Mathi said, “I get that. Variety is a kind of information.”

Alma nodded. “And stability is a chance to think.”

They sat under the shifting shade of the seventh tree, letting the breeze scatter their thoughts.

At one point, two sparrows landed five feet from them and began squabbling over a stray piece of lettuce. The smaller bird won. They both watched, amused.

When the sparrows flew away, Alma said, “Do you ever feel like the system... listens?”

Mathi considered. “Not listens. But maybe... observes?”

“Like it’s trying to guess what we mean from the things we don’t think about twice.”

“And then puts us in teams that make no sense,” Mathi concluded.

Alma grinned. “The predictions need work.”

They ate the last of their lunches. The sun shifted. The wind picked up a bit, carrying the smell of citrus from Alma’s dish.

Finally, as if by mutual understanding, they stood.

When they reached the corner where their paths diverged, they paused at almost the same moment.

“Well,” Alma said, the thought unfinished.

“Yeah,” Mathi agreed.

They returned to their respective floors. Inside, their dashboards pulsed with new assignments.

## 4.

The diner was in one of its long, honey-colored hours, the kind that seemed to stretch time rather than pass through it. Sunlight slanted in at an angle that made every chrome surface glow. The air held that particular late-afternoon softness - like the inside of a seashell - where sound pooled but didn’t echo.

Mathi and Alma had taken the booth beneath the large front window, the one where the blinds were always slightly crooked. Their screens glowed with green pins, soil moisture readings, volunteer sign-up notes, growing-season projections. It had begun as a small idea - something they’d joked about - and now it was quietly gathering form. The map had a living quality. The cluster of green markers felt like seedlings pushing up through digital soil. Where the pins thickened, it gave the impression of vines exploring new terrain. Where they thinned, it looked like a trellis waiting for someone to train a branch along it.

Frankie approached.

“Your forest’s getting bigger,” she said, studying the screen.

“It’s not a forest yet,” Alma replied.

“Well, it looks like it wants to be,” Frankie said, which somehow mattered.

The receipt printer at the counter produced a new slip for a trio of students hunched over milkshakes and textbooks. They giggled at whatever had been suggested, exchanging looks of conspiratorial delight.

The diner was in a benevolent mood that day - watchful, patient, amused by the world finding its way.

Mathi noticed a small patch of paint on the far wall he’d never really looked at before - a tiny chipped area revealing older colors underneath. Peach beneath cream, beneath an even older shade of dusty blue. The place was layered, lived-in, accumulated. Like tree rings that didn’t bother arranging themselves into tidy circles.

He exhaled. His whole body softened.

// todo: might be a little too suggestive
Alma nudged him gently with her knee, wordlessly asking if he was okay.

He gave her the half-smile reserved for people who already understand the answer.

They worked in a silence that wasn’t empty. It felt more like the silence of a garden: the quiet that’s full of small, earnest activity.

Alma’s phone buzzed once. She lifted it, read, and tilted the screen toward him.

The headline read like a parody of itself: **SYSTEMIC ALIGNMENT PROJECT SHIFTING TO STRATEGIC PIVOT.**

Mathi barked an incredulous laugh. “That’s one way to put it.”

He skimmed the article. Phrases leapt out at him: *behavioral adjacency misfires*, *unintended redeployment spirals*, *role dissolution events*, *compatibility misinterpretation*.

“They never say what actually happened,” he murmured.

“They won’t,” Alma said. She spooned some foam from her tea and let it dissolve again. “Wall Street admits collapse the way people admit heartbreak. With a rebound.”

He glanced around the diner. A teenager in a letterman jacket was showing his grandmother how to use a QR code. A pair of paramedics shared pancakes after a long shift. A man in a paint-splattered hoodie sketched ideas on the back of a placemat.

“That place feels like an ancient memory,” he said.

“Good riddance,” Alma replied.

Their shoulders relaxed at the same time.

The kitchen door swung open with a soft thump, and Augusta appeared balancing a tower of clean glasses in one arm, an unruly pile of sketches under another. She always looked like she was listening - to the building, to the customers, to the quiet logic of how people move when they’re not pretending.

She paused when she saw Mathi and Alma bent over their project.

// todo: too much 'up to something' here
“You two look like you’re up to something,” she said.

“We are,” Alma said, not looking up from her screen.

Frankie emerged with a box of napkins tucked under her arm. She set it down with a sigh, then froze when she saw Augusta's pile.

“Ugh,” Frankie said. “Are you thinking of expanding again?”

Augusta blinked with exaggerated innocence. “I’m only sketching. Sketching isn’t expanding.”

“It’s pre-expanding,” Frankie said.

Mathi stirred. “What's going on?”

Frankie and Augusta exchanged a glance that was hard to decipher - half deflection, half excitement.

“Nothing,” Frankie said.

“Something,” Augusta corrected archly.

The sketches were subtle: schematic lines, penciled notes about windows, arrows pointing to imagined breezeways. No two drawings looked alike. One showed a long, narrow café tucked beside a laundromat. Another depicted a sunlit room with a single communal table. A third had a rooftop patio full of potted citrus trees.

Frankie tapped the notepad. “People keep asking us how the printer works. Whether we could start another place somewhere. But this diner is... this diner.”

“It doesn’t want to be duplicated,” Augusta said.

“But maybe,” Frankie said slowly, “there’s such a thing as cousins.”

Mathi felt something expand in the air. Not ambition. Not empire. More like branches - stretching outward at their own pace, following the light.

Augusta pulled out the sketch at the bottom of the pile - a drawing of a building that resembled the diner if you squinted, but the details were different. More plants. Wider windows. A porch meant for lingering.

“I think of it like a network,” she said, making a face at the word. “But that's not quite right.”

Frankie glared. “If anyone suggests a franchise model, I’ll throw their pancakes out the window.”

Augusta tapped the drawing again. “I’m thinking about places that know each other. Places that hear the same wind. Like trees in a grove. They don’t match, but they rhyme.”

Mathi nodded slowly. “Like how a root system isn’t organized the way people want it to be.”

“Yes!” Augusta said. “Messy on paper, perfect in practice.”

“This sketch feels like it wants to exist,” Alma said.

Frankie rolled her eyes, shrugged. “If it starts printing me blueprints, I’m quitting.”

From the counter, the receipt printer whirred softly, almost teasing.

***

They had soup for dinner - miso for Alma, lentil curry for Mathi.

Frankie left their check face down on the table, a casual gesture. Mathi reached for it, more out of habit than anything, but paused when he turned it over.

The numbers were there - subtotal, tax, a polite space for tip. But at the bottom, tucked almost shyly into the lower margin, were two words printed in the smallest font the machine could manage:

// todo: kind of hate this
**good team**
