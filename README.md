Draft — Beats 1–3
1. Opening image: the check with a suggestion

The man had only stopped at Frankie’s Diner because the highway spat him out at the wrong exit. He was traveling alone—midwestern plates, rental-car crumbs, an itinerary that looked self-imposed. The sort of person who orders the day’s special without asking what it is.

Now he sat in his vinyl booth, jacket folded beside him, coffee cooling. When Frankie dropped the check, he glanced at the total, reached for his wallet—then paused.

At the bottom of the receipt, beneath TAX and TOTAL and the small apology about a three-percent card surcharge, there was a final line he had never seen on a diner slip in his life:

Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.

He blinked. Read it again.
Raised an eyebrow, the polite midwestern kind that signaled both curiosity and a desire not to make a fuss.

He turned the paper over. The back was blank.

He looked around to see if anyone else had been slipped a cryptic fortune-cookie message disguised as a bill. Everyone else seemed unconcerned. A teenager slurped a milkshake. A pair of construction workers argued amiably about screws. A woman with a laptop typed with collected calm.

The man looked back at the receipt:
LENORA — Wednesdays.
He didn’t know a Lenora. He wasn’t even usually in the state.

When Frankie returned with the card machine, he held up the slip between two fingers.

“Uh,” he said, “is this… for me?”

She didn’t even glance at it. “Yep.”

“And—what is it?”

“Just a suggestion,” she said, in the same tone one might use to identify a side salad. “If you want it.”

He didn’t know whether to laugh or be vaguely unsettled.

Frankie, meanwhile, was already moving toward the next table, coffee pot in hand.

2. Frankie’s casual explanation

When she circled back, wiping her hands on her apron, the man gestured her over with the sheepish gravity of someone about to ask something he feared might be obvious to everyone else.

“So,” he said, “this match thing. Is it… I don’t know… some loyalty program?”

Frankie snorted, a tiny, private sound. “No. It’s Augusta’s project.”

“Augusta?”

“My cousin.” A beat. “Visiting for a bit. Tinkers with things.”

Her voice had the steady, unbothered warmth of someone who ran a diner well and saw no reason to add embellishment. She looked tired in the way people look tired when they are very good at their jobs and no longer need to prove it.

“People say it works,” she added, as though reporting on the weather. “I just run the place.”

“So I’m being set up?”

“Not unless you want to be.” She poured him more coffee without asking. “You can ignore it. Most folks do. Or pretend to.”

There was no hint of salesmanship. No inclination to explain further. She was already pivoting to greet a regular who’d slipped in behind him.

The man looked again at the slip of paper lying innocently beside his saucer.
As if it had printed itself merely to pass the time.

3. Quick glimpses of other customers engaging with it

He noticed it only once he started looking for it. The little suggestions, tucked at the bottoms of other people’s checks like extra punctuation marks.

At the counter, the teenager with the milkshake picked up her receipt, read it, and grinned.

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

She snapped a picture and sent it to someone with the speed of long practice.

Near the window, one of the construction workers read his own line—

“Jogging partner.”
—and groaned theatrically.

“I don’t jog,” he protested to no one in particular. The other worker clapped him on the back and said, “That’s why it’s a suggestion.”

At the far end, the laptop woman slid her bill under her palm, but not before the man caught the final line:

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”

She blinked, once, a short laugh escaping her, like a note struck by accident.

Nobody seemed confused by any of it. Mildly entertained, perhaps. Or resigned, the way one is resigned to a town’s particular quirks: the one stoplight that never times right, the one neighbor who leaves zucchini on everyone’s porch.

The suggestions were strange—too specific not to mean something, too gentle to be intrusive. They hovered between the absurd and the oddly insightful, like the diner somehow knew more about its clientele than its clientele knew about themselves.

The man folded his slip and tucked it into his wallet. For later, he told himself, though he wasn’t sure what “later” meant.

The receipt printer behind the counter whirred, sputtered, then spat out another check as though clearing its throat. The sound carried a faint sense of deliberation.

As if the machine was thinking.

Draft — Beat 4: Establishing the tone of techno-magical realism

By the time the man stood to leave, the diner had taken on a quality he couldn’t quite place—something faintly animate, as if the air kept remembering things.

The receipt printer behind the counter gave a small, syncopated cough, then a hesitant chk-chk-chhk as it fed new paper through. Frankie didn’t touch it. No one had pressed a button. The machine worked in its own rhythm: pauses that felt contemplative, followed by little bursts of decisiveness. It reminded him, absurdly, of someone muttering to themselves while solving a crossword.

The overhead lights hummed with a soft warmth, flickering not in the way of old fixtures but in a way that suggested attention—like they brightened half a shade whenever someone laughed, dimmed gently when a conversation turned private. The griddle’s low sizzle blended with the refrigerator’s steady breath, creating an odd harmony, a domestic heartbeat under the mundane noise.

A couple at a side booth received their check. The man watched as the printer finished with a theatrical final twitch—almost a flourish—and Frankie tore the paper free. She set it on their table without ceremony. Neither diner looked surprised when they read the line at the bottom. They nodded once, like this was something they’d expected.

Maybe everyone here had grown accustomed to the diner’s small murmurs of insight.
Maybe nobody questioned where the suggestions came from because the answers, if they existed, were less interesting than the results.

The man lingered by the door for a moment, listening. The whole place seemed to exhale, a soft release of air that wasn’t mechanical so much as communal—an organism settling back into its posture after being briefly observed.

Outside, the highway roared indifferently. Here, something else was happening. Something quiet. Something that behaved as though data had a pulse.

He stepped into the sunlight, receipt tucked securely in his wallet, the line about LENORA — Wednesdays repeating in the back of his mind like a tune he hadn’t meant to memorize.
