Frankie's head bent over the calculator, strands of wavy hair floating in the breeze of the fan and occasionally bothering her figures. As her fingers flew across the keys the printer tape advanced steadily outward, spilling past the edge of the desk and onto the floor.

She enjoyed spinning the thread of numbers in this way, though it was an arduous task that she regretted in hindsight every quarter. There was something pure in the ache of it all, something noble about making these little slips of papers, these greasy old receipts, manifest in physical form.

She finished a stack and looked up, as though someone else might have been standing over her. But there was no one in the cramped little office, just her desk and a chair opposite, struggling under the weight of a full years' worth of grubby paperworkj.

A year had passed since Johnny had died.

Once the initial shock faded, and the funeral passed, and the stream of mourners slowed to a trickle, Frankie reopened the diner. At first it seemed like an insult to his memory, to hire a line cook to take his place. With time, Frankie realized that the diner was exactly what she needed. The routine of opening the doors each morning, the flow of boisterous customers, the sizzle of eggs cracking over the griddle - it all felt right, somehow. Surely Johnny would have approved.

The loneliness was its own kind of company, she found. The bare lightbulb hanging overhead, a single beam of light illuminating the dusty and windowless office - there was nothing she preferred, when working on the books. There was a reason she didn't camp out at a booth in the diner, as Johnny sometimes liked to do, to be enveloped by the clatter of plates and the gurgle of chatter at the other tables. Why bother with all the well-wishers who would inevitably pass by, when she had a perfectly nice box of receipts at her fingertips?

It was not the greasy food that took Johnny away, surprisingly. He sampled his own wares quite freely, but never had so much as an uncomfortable checkup at the doctor's. Something of a modern miracle, the doctor used to say, a cook at a greasy spoon with a healthy ticker. Johnny liked to repeat that line often, it was like a magical talisman decorating his neck. Frankie sometimes wondered if it was the repetition itself which brought him good health. Doctors always had tricks like that up their sleeves.
