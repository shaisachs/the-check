# The Check

## 1.

The man had only stopped at the diner because the highway spat him out at the wrong exit. He was traveling alone - midwestern plates, rental-car crumbs, an itinerary that looked self-imposed. The sort of person who orders the day’s special without asking what it is.

Now he sat in his vinyl booth, jacket folded beside him, coffee cooling. When Frankie dropped the check, he glanced at the total, reached for his wallet - then paused.

At the bottom of the receipt, beneath TAX and TOTAL and the small apology about a three-percent card surcharge, there was a final line he had never seen on a diner slip in his life:

**Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.**

He blinked. Read it again.

Raised an eyebrow, the polite midwestern kind that signaled both curiosity and a desire not to make a fuss.

He turned the paper over. The back was blank.

He looked around to see if anyone else had been slipped a cryptic fortune-cookie message disguised as a bill. Everyone else seemed unconcerned. A teenager slurped a milkshake. A pair of construction workers argued amiably about screws. A woman with a laptop typed with collected calm.

The man looked back at the receipt:

**LENORA — Wednesdays.**

He didn’t know a Lenora. He wasn’t even usually in the state.

When Frankie returned with the card machine, he held up the slip between two fingers.

“Uh,” he said, “is this... for me?”

She didn’t even glance at it. “Yep.”

“And - what is it?”

“Just a suggestion,” she said, in the same tone one might use to identify a side salad. “If you want it.”

He didn’t know whether to laugh or to run.

Frankie, meanwhile, was already moving toward the next table, coffee pot in hand.

When she circled back, wiping her hands on her apron, the man gestured her over with the sheepish gravity of someone about to ask something he feared might be obvious to everyone else.

“So,” he said, “this match thing. Is it... I don’t know... some loyalty program?”

Frankie snorted, a tiny, private sound. “No. It’s Augusta’s project.”

“Augusta?”

“My cousin.” A beat. “Visiting for a bit. Very thorough.”

The man looked up at Frankie, as though hopefully expecting more. But she gave hima funny sort of half-frown, as though tasting a creatively-spiced experiment in pasta sauce.

“People say it works,” she added.

“So I’m being set up?”

“Not unless you want to be.” She poured him more coffee without asking. “You can ignore it. Most folks do. Or pretend to.”

No inclination to explain further. She was already pivoting to greet a regular who’d slipped in behind him.

The man looked again at the slip of paper lying innocently beside his saucer. As if it had printed itself merely to pass the time.

He peered carefully at the other diners. Perhaps there was something they knew that he didn't.

At the counter, the teenager with the milkshake picked up her receipt, read it, and grinned.

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

She snapped a picture and sent it to someone with the speed of long practice.

Near the window, one of the construction workers read his own line: “Jogging partner.” He groaned theatrically. “I don’t jog,” he protested to no one in particular. The other worker clapped him on the back and said, “That’s why it’s a suggestion.”

At the far end, the laptop woman slid her bill under her palm:

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”

She blinked, once, a short laugh escaping her, like a note struck by accident.

// todo: fix the "or resigned.."
Nobody seemed confused by any of it. Mildly entertained, perhaps. Or accustomed, the way one becomes accustomed to the hiccups of the everyday: the one stoplight that never times right, the one neighbor who leaves zucchini on everyone’s porch.

The suggestions were strange — too specific to be meaningless, too gentle to be intrusive. They hovered between the absurd and the oddly insightful, like the diner somehow knew more about its patrons than they knew about themselves.

The man folded his slip and tucked it into his wallet. For later, he told himself, though he wasn’t sure what “later” meant.

The receipt printer behind the counter whirred, sputtered, then spat out another check as though clearing its throat. The sound carried a faint sense of deliberation. Frankie didn’t touch it. No one had pressed a button. The machine worked in its own rhythm: pauses that felt contemplative, followed by little bursts of decisiveness. Like someone muttering to themselves while solving a crossword.

The overhead lights hummed with a soft warmth, flickering not in the way of old fixtures but in a way that suggested attention — like they brightened half a shade whenever someone laughed, dimmed gently when a conversation turned private. The griddle’s low sizzle blended with the refrigerator’s steady breath, creating an odd harmony, a domestic heartbeat under the mundane noise.

The man watched as the printer finished with a theatrical final twitch - almost a flourish - and Frankie tore the paper free. She set it on a couple's table without ceremony. Neither diner looked surprised when they read the line at the bottom. They nodded once, like the match was something they’d expected.

Maybe everyone here had grown accustomed to the diner’s small murmurs of insight. Maybe nobody questioned where the suggestions came from because the explanation, if it existed, was less interesting than the matches.

The man lingered by the door for a moment, listening. The whole place seemed to exhale, a soft release of air that wasn’t mechanical so much as communal - an organism settling back into its posture after being briefly observed.

Outside, the highway roared indifferently. Here, something else was happening. Something quiet. Something that behaved as though checks had a pulse.

He stepped into the sunlight, receipt tucked securely in his wallet, the line about **LENORA — Wednesdays** repeating in the back of his mind like a tune he hadn’t meant to memorize.

## 2.

It was some time ago that the diner closed for an afternoon -  an event rare enough that locals might have taken pictures if they’d passed by. But they knew better than that. The handwritten sign on the door, *BE BACK TOMORROW — PROBABLY*, fluttered whenever a car whooshed past. The windows reflected a pale winter sun, giving the whole place the appearance of napping.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of bleach and lemon oil, as though Frankie had attempted a perfunctory cleaning before admitting defeat. The lights were set to half, casting long, slow shadows across the checkered floor.

Augusta stood in the aisle like an explorer surveying ruins. Her hair was shoved into a bun that had clearly been negotiated rather than styled. She wore a sweater with sleeves pushed past her elbows and a look of delighted overwhelm.

“I swear it wasn’t always such a mess,” Frankie muttered as she tried to shove a dolly - laden with boxes of mysterious provenance - toward the storage room.

Augusta smiled without teasing. “That’s because there was a system.”

“That’s generous,” Frankie returned.

The boxes were stacked in erratic towers, some leaning like they were tired of holding themselves up. A crate labeled *MYSTERY LIDS* sat atop a box labeled *EXTRA STRAWS (WHY SO MANY?)*.

Frankie bent to pick up a fallen dish towel. Augusta picked up a stack of menus, flipping through them as if they might contain secrets.

“Why do you have four versions of the breakfast menu?” Augusta asked.

“We kept redesigning it,” Frankie said. “But every time we printed a new draft, someone would complain the font looked funny.”

They laughed quietly together - an easy, shared rhythm that made the task feel more manageable.

Outside, the sound of snowmelt tapping onto a metal bucket offered a slow, rhythmic accompaniment.

The diner hummed—a low, collective murmur of refrigerators, lights, and vents—as though it were listening in.

Frankie braced herself and shouldered the storage room door open. It resisted with the stubbornness of a place that had been neglected long enough to develop opinions. When it finally gave way, something inside shifted with a soft *shfff*, and a box slid out, thumping against her boot.

“Oh no,” she said.

Augusta peeked over her shoulder and let out a low whistle.

The room was a chaos of cardboard: towers that leaned precariously, narrow passages between stacks, labels written in elegant handwriting - every letter precise, elegant, and a touch theatrical.

Augusta crouched. “Let’s see. Receipts A-C, 1998–2002.” She checked another. “Pie Orders, 1998.”

She scanned the wall of boxes. “Do these boxes contain... everything?”

Frankie sat on the floor in response. Cross-legged.

Augusta lifted the lid of a box, releasing a dusty breath that smelled faintly of old paper and cinnamon. Inside were bundles of receipts tied with red-and-white baker’s twine. Each bundle had annotations: little circles around menu items, arrows between orders, tiny notes like *ask about her sister*, *same order every Thursday*, *avoid seating them near table 2 - acoustic issues?*.

“You have an archive,” Augusta whispered.

Frankie’s groan was half-embarrassment, half-affection.

Augusta pulled one bundle free and set it on the counter like it was fragile. The handwriting curled in soft loops along the margins. Each slip felt like a miniature diary entry from someone who had always noticed more than he let on.

The dining room felt suddenly smaller, or maybe warmer—memory pressing in without suffocating.

The next morning, Augusta arrived with a flatbed scanner that looked suspiciously fresh for something she claimed to have “borrowed.” It took up half the counter, its cord snake-trailing behind the pie display.

“Please tell me you’re not scanning *all* of it,” Frankie said, pouring herself a coffee.

“Not today,” Augusta said. “But soon. Paper fades. Memories too. Might as well save what we can.”

She set to work with clinical enthusiasm: lift a receipt, flatten it gently, press the lid of the scanner closed, tap the keyboard with a flourish. The machine hummed with a steady, patient rhythm.

Frankie watched her for a while, then wandered off to reorganize the tea shelf-a task she’d been avoiding for months. Every few minutes, the soft whir of the scanner drifted through the diner, creating a kind of irregular heartbeat.

“You know these aren’t historically important,” Frankie said eventually.

Augusta held up a receipt with a swirl of arrows and a note that said *ask about the dog park—he’ll appreciate it*.

“This check is history,” she said. “Just not the kind museums know how to display.”

Frankie didn’t answer. Wordlessly she set out two slices of pie.

The receipt printer across the room whirred once, abruptly, as if clearing its throat.

Augusta glanced over. “Do your appliances normally talk to each other?”

Frankie shrugged. “They’ve got opinions.”

***

It happened on a Tuesday. Of course it was a Tuesday.

Augusta had scanned thousands of receipts by then, feeding them into a simple indexing program she wrote to categorize dates, patrons, orders, and any scribbled observations. The program was basic - just enough to filter and search.

Except it wasn’t behaving like a basic program.

She searched a name to test something and the program suggested three others who were frequent booth-sharing companions. Except she hadn't asked it to. And none of their checks indicated anything about booth-sharing.

“Odd,” Augusta murmured.

She ran another query. The result flickered, then expanded into a cluster none of her logic accounted for.

“Frankie,” she called. “Your receipts are doing something weird.”

Before Frankie could ask what “weird” meant, the receipt printer sputtered and spat out a slip.

Frankie glanced instinctively over her shoulder. “Did you print something?”

“No,” Augusta said.

Frankie crossed the room. The slip read:

**You should ask her about Thursdays.**

“Her who?” Frankie asked.

The printer whirred again and produced a second slip.

It contained a single comma.

A perfectly centered, unassuming comma.

Augusta stared. “Okay. Now it’s definitely weird.”

The diner hummed around them, unbothered - as though it had simply added a new sound to its ambient repertoire.

Frankie went back to the griddle, muttering, “Not dealing with that thing today.”

Augusta kept watching the printer like it might continue speaking.

***

The first photo of a "suggestion receipt" appeared online courtesy of a tourist who’d stopped in for an omelet. Her slip read:
**Suggested collaborator for your quilt project.**

She posted it with three laughing emojis and the caption: *this diner is legit*, and the internet, being the internet, latched on.
x
Within days, the diner saw an uptick in customers - curious locals, intrigued travelers, people who claimed they “just happened to be passing through” despite having license plates from two states over.

The suggestions varied wildly: **Try the farmers’ market at dawn. You’ll meet him there.**; **Knitters’ circle—Mondays. Bring snacks.**; **Volunteer for the creek cleanup. You’ll like who shows up.**; **Ask about the lemon bars recipe. Trust us.**

A pair of retirees found a shared hobby after their receipts nudged them toward the same birdwatching group. A teenager discovered a friend who loved the same obscure space opera series. A pair of musicians realized they’d both been writing songs alone and started meeting on Thursdays.

People lingered longer. Conversations stretched. Laughter became more frequent, softer but richer.

A journalist came through and described the place as “an oracle disguised as a grill.” Frankie snorted through her nose when she read it but clipped the article and stuck it to the fridge.

The printer chugged along unbothered, offering its suggestions without fanfare. Frankie and Augusta didn’t try to explain it. They didn’t really want to.

It was enough that people kept finding each other.

## 3.

The morning began normally enough for a high-reassignment day—meaning no one commented on it out loud, but everyone behaved as if the floor might tilt at any moment. In the office where Mathi worked, this meant a subtle tightness around people’s eyes and a reluctance to commit to any task for more than ten minutes, in case the system decided to pull it away from them. No one liked to get too attached.

Mathi was in the middle of writing a harmless little data-cleaning script he had already written three times that month—sometimes for the same project, sometimes for indistinguishable ones—when his project dashboard blinked. The browser window blurred for half a second, sharpened again, and the script he was working on vanished from his queue. His cursor now floated over an empty square, blinking as though it were evaluating him.

He glanced up. The rest of the office looked as if it had collectively exhaled and forgotten how to inhale again. Across the aisle, a woman with a tight bun stared at her own screen in a perfect mirror of his expression. Not panic, not anger—just a quiet, resigned bewilderment, the standard emotion of a day when the system’s confidence outran its coherence.

Another notification appeared:

Your workload is being rebalanced for optimal flow. Thank you for your patience.

Mathi rolled his eyes at the phrase optimal flow. There was nothing flowing about it; it felt more like being shuffled around in a very polite washing machine. He clicked the acknowledgment button anyway.

The slot where the script used to be remained blank.

Then, inexplicably, another blank slot beside it also blinked out, leaving two white squares where tasks had once lived. His screen displayed a cheerful message he found especially irritating because of how little it acknowledged what it had done: “You’re all caught up!”

“Sure,” he muttered. “If we define ‘caught up’ as ‘you took all my things away and didn’t tell me why.’”

He stood. Not angrily, not even abruptly—just decisively, in the way someone stands when they sense that any further attempt to behave normally will break something inside them. A walk would be best. Maybe lunch. Maybe early lunch. Maybe extremely early lunch.

He glanced around. He wasn’t the only one standing. Three other people in his row had risen within the same ten-second window, seeming to drift toward the exit as though nudged by the same gentle algorithmic breeze.

Mathi didn’t want to walk with anyone. He veered toward the side stairwell, took it two floors down, and pushed through the glass doors into the street. The sunlight hit him in a surprising burst. It was warmer than he expected for the season, or perhaps the building’s climate control had numbed his senses again.

Across the street, the little park beckoned. It wasn’t much—a sloping patch of grass, seven slim trees planted on a precisely spaced grid the city insisted improved “urban canopy equity,” and a small paved path that didn’t quite connect to anything meaningful. But it provided shade, and dirt, and a place to sit where the ground wasn’t carpeted.

That was enough.

—

Two blocks away, Alma stared at a calendar notification that contradicted the one she had closed seconds earlier.

Meeting: Pre-meeting agenda alignment (rescheduled).

The icon pulsed faintly, which bothered her because she didn’t remember icons pulsing before today.

She tapped to open it. The participant list was identical to the meeting she had canceled this morning—the one she had canceled twice, to be precise, because it kept snapping back into existence like an overeager child insisting she admire the same drawing again and again.

“No,” she said to her screen, pressing her fingertip to the cancel button with unnecessary force. “Go away.”

The meeting dissolved. She watched the space it left in her calendar, as if making sure it stayed erased this time.

It didn’t. A new event—identical in every way—slid neatly into the same slot in the following week.

Alma closed her eyes. No deep breaths, no self-talk—just the simple act of closing her eyes to stop the nonsense from reaching her brain. When she opened them again, the meeting was still there, smugly rectangular.

She reached for her bag.

Lunch. Lunch now. Fresh air now. A tree now.

Her feet carried her out of the building faster than she expected. The elevator was too slow, so she took the stairs, one hand grazing the rail, partly for balance and partly for something steady to hold in a morning that refused to be steady.

When she stepped outside, she was startled to see how bright the day had become. The city looked almost too crisp—edges sharp, colors oversaturated, like the world had been lightly retuned.

She crossed toward the park.

—

The tree—the best tree—was waiting.

Everyone in the office buildings nearby knew which one it was. Not the northernmost tree, whose shade was good but whose roots created uncomfortable ridges. Not the center tree, whose branches were too sparse. Not the one plagued by the pigeon with the unsettlingly human stare.

The good tree. Wide shade, soft grass, the only one that didn’t tilt.

Mathi reached it first, an early lunch victor, and dropped into the shade with something like relief. He opened his lunch bag—a reusable cloth pouch he insisted on using because the universe had already given him enough disposable packaging for three lifetimes—and withdrew the compostable clamshell container. He had no memory of choosing eggplant today, but eggplant wasn’t the worst thing that could happen to him this morning, so he accepted it.

A minute later, someone approached the tree.

Alma slowed when she saw it was taken. She hesitated, scanning the slope for another open spot, but everywhere she looked felt unwelcoming. Too sunny, too crowded, or with grass damp enough to cling to clothing. This tree was the right place. She stepped closer.

“Sorry—mind if I join?” she asked.

Mathi looked up. For a split second he wondered if the tree had assigned him a friend. The thought was ridiculous, but so was the morning.

“No, of course,” he said. “Plenty of space.”

Alma sat, carefully, as if respecting the ground. She placed her identical clamshell container on the grass between them. It took them a moment to register the symmetry.

“Oh,” Mathi said.

“Huh,” Alma echoed.

They opened their boxes simultaneously. Identical lunches, right down to the garnish. Mathi glanced at her in mild disbelief.

“You got eggplant too?”

“I didn’t mean to order eggplant,” Alma said. “I just… clicked.”

“Same.”

They compared receipts. Alma pulled hers from her pocket; Mathi’s had been folded into his pouch. The timestamp glowed with absurd precision.

12:06:14 PM
12:06:14 PM

Same second. Same restaurant. Same order ID prefix.

Alma stared at the numbers, then exhaled sharply. “Okay but this doesn’t have to mean anything.”

Mathi nodded. “No, totally. Just a wild coincidence.”

They both knew it wasn’t just that. But naming it would make it real, and neither wanted reality to get ideas.

For a while they ate quietly. The city hummed around them in its usual uneven rhythm—traffic, snippets of conversation drifting from benches, a dog somewhere out of sight barking with a steady determination.

Then Alma said, “Did your work reshuffle today?”

“Four times before eleven.”

“Three for me.”

Mathi raised an eyebrow. “Three? Lucky.”

“Don’t congratulate me too quickly. My calendar tried to unionize.”

Mathi laughed—an unsteady, unguarded sound. Alma smiled despite herself.

They talked a little about their mornings, lightly comparing notes without digging too deeply. They didn’t know each other, not really. But the shade of the tree created a small permission, like an unspoken truce.

At one point a drone delivery approached overhead. The tiny machine buzzed in a low, insect-like whir that made Mathi tense. It hovered near their tree, then directly above them, pausing with a faint mechanical indecision.

Alma looked up warily. “Is it supposed to do that?”

“No,” Mathi said. “Unless we accidentally ordered a second lunch.”

“No eggplant is worth this surveillance.”

The drone drifted a few feet away, as if reconsidering its priorities, then descended to deliver a meal to a man on a bench. The moment the bag left its claws, it zipped upward and vanished behind a building.

“That was weird,” Mathi said.

“Everything today is weird.”

Mathi picked at the pickled onions, nudging them into small piles. “Maybe we’re being reassigned as friends.”

Alma gave him a look—flat, amused, exhausted. “Not today, please. I’m at capacity.”

Mathi grinned. “Fair.”

But something warm threaded through the moment, despite Alma’s deadpan. A shared pulse of humor, or recognition, or simply an anchor in a morning that felt like it couldn’t hold its own shape.

They fell into easier conversation after that. Mathi learned Alma had transferred to the department two months ago. Alma learned Mathi had been with the company long enough to remember when the system reshuffled tasks only weekly and people had time to finish things.

They talked about the tree—how much they both liked it, how it was strange that a single tree could feel so dependable in a world built of shifting schedules and autorebalanced workflows. Alma mentioned she often brought a book to sit here, though lately she rarely got the chance. Mathi admitted he sometimes ate lunch here just to feel the ground under him.

“Everything inside feels too… smooth,” he said, searching for the right word. “Like it was designed for people who don’t sweat.”

“I know what you mean,” Alma said. “The floor is always too clean. The air is always the exact same temperature. Even the chairs don’t squeak.”

Mathi nodded. “This tree squeaks.”

Alma laughed so suddenly she startled herself. “It does! The branches creak when it’s windy.”

“Exactly. That’s why it’s reliable.”

They fell quiet again, not uncomfortably. The grass was cool where it hadn’t been warmed by the sun. The shade felt like a room with no walls, soft-edged and temporary.

At some point, a breeze picked up. The receipts they’d left beside them fluttered. Alma reached to pin hers down just as Mathi reached for his—and in the same instant, the wind strengthened and lifted both receipts an inch off the ground, holding them suspended in a moment of impossible balance.

They froze, watching. The papers floated together, as if tethered, then drifted downward at the exact same angle. When they landed, they hit the grass gently—side by side again, as though the wind had decided to pair them.

Alma’s eyes widened. “Okay,” she said softly. “That one wasn’t nothing.”

Mathi swallowed. “No. It wasn’t.”

They didn’t interpret it. They didn’t try. They simply sat with it, letting the strangeness settle between them like a third presence—one neither hostile nor friendly, just persistent.

Eventually they stood. The sun had shifted; the tree’s shade cast a new shape across the grass. Alma brushed her hands against her pants. Mathi tucked the receipts into his pouch out of a sudden, odd sense of responsibility—as if leaving them behind would be rude.

They walked toward the office together. Not side by side, not deliberately matching each other’s pace—but their footsteps aligned now and then, falling into rhythm for a few steps before drifting apart.

When they reached the lobby doors, they paused simultaneously.

“Well,” Alma said, checking her watch though she didn’t need the time.

“Yeah,” Mathi replied.

Neither quite knew what came next.

They stepped inside—not together, but not apart either—and the building greeted them with its usual neutral hum. The air felt cooler than before, or maybe they had warmed in the sun.

For the rest of the day, neither of them mentioned the meeting at the tree.

But each time their dashboards flashed—once for Alma, twice for Mathi—they both felt the earlier synchronicities echo faintly, like ripples on a pond that had not fully stilled.

Outside, the tree shifted in the breeze, creaking softly in a way that suggested it had been paying attention.

## 4.

The diner was in one of its long, honey-colored hours, the kind that seemed to stretch time rather than pass through it. Sunlight slanted in at an angle that made every chrome surface glow. The air held that particular late-afternoon softness - like the inside of a seashell - where sound pooled but didn’t echo.

Mathi and Alma had taken the booth beneath the large front window, the one where the blinds were always slightly crooked. Their screens glowed with green pins, soil moisture readings, volunteer sign-up notes, growing-season projections. It had begun as a small idea - something they’d joked about - and now it was quietly gathering form. The map had a living quality. The cluster of green markers felt like seedlings pushing up through digital soil. Where the pins thickened, it gave the impression of vines exploring new terrain. Where they thinned, it looked like a trellis waiting for someone to train a branch along it.

Frankie approached.

“Your forest’s getting bigger,” she said, studying the screen.

“It’s not a forest yet,” Alma replied.

“Well, it looks like it wants to be,” Frankie said, which somehow mattered.

The receipt printer at the counter produced a new slip for a trio of students hunched over milkshakes and textbooks. They giggled at whatever had been suggested, exchanging looks of conspiratorial delight.

The diner was in a benevolent mood that day - watchful, patient, amused by the world finding its way.

Mathi noticed a small patch of paint on the far wall he’d never really looked at before - a tiny chipped area revealing older colors underneath. Peach beneath cream, beneath an even older shade of dusty blue. The place was layered, lived-in, accumulated. Like tree rings that didn’t bother arranging themselves into tidy circles.

He exhaled. His whole body softened.

// todo: might be a little too suggestive
Alma nudged him gently with her knee, wordlessly asking if he was okay.

He gave her the half-smile reserved for people who already understand the answer.

They worked in a silence that wasn’t empty. It felt more like the silence of a garden: the quiet that’s full of small, earnest activity.

Alma’s phone buzzed once. She lifted it, read, and tilted the screen toward him.

The headline read like a parody of itself: **SYSTEMIC ALIGNMENT PROJECT SHIFTING TO STRATEGIC PIVOT.**

Mathi barked an incredulous laugh. “That’s one way to put it.”

He skimmed the article. Phrases leapt out at him: *behavioral adjacency misfires*, *unintended redeployment spirals*, *role dissolution events*, *compatibility misinterpretation*.

// todo: too blunt
He winced. The language felt like someone describing a broken relationship using only engineering terms.

“They never say what actually happened,” he murmured.

“They won’t,” Alma said. She spooned some foam from her tea and let it dissolve again. “Wall Street admits collapse the way people admit heartbreak. With a rebound.”

He glanced around the diner. A teenager in a letterman jacket was showing his grandmother how to use a QR code. A pair of paramedics shared pancakes after a long shift. A man in a paint-splattered hoodie sketched ideas on the back of a placemat.

“That place feels like an ancient memory,” he said.

“Good riddance,” Alma replied.

Their shoulders relaxed at the same time.

The kitchen door swung open with a soft thump, and Augusta appeared balancing a tower of clean glasses in one arm, an unruly pile of sketches under another. She always looked like she was listening - to the building, to the customers, to the quiet logic of how people move when they’re not pretending.

She paused when she saw Mathi and Alma bent over their project.

// todo: too much 'up to something' here
“You two look like you’re up to something,” she said.

“We are,” Alma said, not looking up from her screen.

Frankie emerged with a box of napkins tucked under her arm. She set it down with a sigh, then froze when she saw Augusta's pile.

“Ugh,” Frankie said. “Are you thinking of expanding again?”

Augusta blinked with exaggerated innocence. “I’m only sketching. Sketching isn’t expanding.”

“It’s pre-expanding,” Frankie said.

Mathi stirred. “What's going on?”

Frankie and Augusta exchanged a glance that was hard to decipher - half deflection, half excitement.

“Nothing,” Frankie said.

“Something,” Augusta corrected archly.

The sketches were subtle: schematic lines, penciled notes about windows, arrows pointing to imagined breezeways. No two drawings looked alike. One showed a long, narrow café tucked beside a laundromat. Another depicted a sunlit room with a single communal table. A third had a rooftop patio full of potted citrus trees.

Frankie tapped the notepad. “People keep asking us how the printer works. Whether we could start another place somewhere. But this diner is... this diner.”

“It doesn’t want to be duplicated,” Augusta said.

“But maybe,” Frankie said slowly, “there’s such a thing as cousins.”

Mathi felt something expand in the air. Not ambition. Not empire. More like branches - stretching outward at their own pace, following the light.

Augusta pulled out the sketch at the bottom of the pile - a drawing of a building that resembled the diner if you squinted, but the details were different. More plants. Wider windows. A porch meant for lingering.

“I think of it like a network,” she said, making a face at the word. “But that's not quite right.”

Frankie glared. “If anyone suggests a franchise model, I’ll throw their pancakes out the window.”

Augusta tapped the drawing again. “I’m thinking about places that know each other. Places that hear the same wind. Like trees in a grove. They don’t match, but they rhyme.”

Mathi nodded slowly. “Like how a root system isn’t organized the way people want it to be.”

“Yes!” Augusta said. “Messy on paper, perfect in practice.”

// todo: ugh
“There’s a kind of wisdom in it,” Alma said. “A quiet one.”

Augusta’s eyes sparkled. “Not instructions. Not predictions. Just... noticing. And offering.”

“This sketch feels like it wants to exist,” Alma said.

Frankie rolled her eyes, shrugged. “If it starts printing me blueprints, I’m quitting.”

From the counter, the receipt printer whirred softly, almost teasing.

***

They had soup for dinner - miso for Alma, lentil curry for Mathi.

Frankie left their check face down on the table, a casual gesture. Mathi reached for it, more out of habit than anything, but paused when he turned it over.

The numbers were there - subtotal, tax, a polite space for tip. But at the bottom, tucked almost shyly into the lower margin, were two words printed in the smallest font the machine could manage:

// todo: kind of hate this
**good team**
