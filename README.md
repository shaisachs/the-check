# The Check

## 1.

The man had only stopped at the diner because the highway spat him out at the wrong exit. He was traveling alone - midwestern plates, rental-car crumbs, an itinerary that looked self-imposed. The sort of person who orders the day’s special without asking what it is.

Now he sat in his vinyl booth, jacket folded beside him, coffee cooling. When Frankie dropped the check, he glanced at the total, reached for his wallet - then paused.

At the bottom of the receipt, beneath TAX and TOTAL and the small apology about a three-percent card surcharge, there was a final line he had never seen on a diner slip in his life:

**Suggested Match: LENORA — Wednesdays, apple pie. Try the counter seats.**

He blinked. Read it again.

Raised an eyebrow, the polite midwestern kind that signaled both curiosity and a desire not to make a fuss.

He turned the paper over. The back was blank.

He looked around to see if anyone else had been slipped a cryptic fortune-cookie message disguised as a bill. Everyone else seemed unconcerned. A teenager slurped a milkshake. A pair of construction workers argued amiably about screws. A woman with a laptop typed with collected calm.

The man looked back at the receipt:

**LENORA — Wednesdays.**

He didn’t know a Lenora. He wasn’t even usually in the state.

When Frankie returned with the card machine, he held up the slip between two fingers.

“Uh,” he said, “is this... for me?”

She didn’t even glance at it. “Yep.”

“And - what is it?”

“Just a suggestion,” she said, in the same tone one might use to identify a side salad. “If you want it.”

He didn’t know whether to laugh or to run.

Frankie, meanwhile, was already moving toward the next table, coffee pot in hand.

When she circled back, wiping her hands on her apron, the man gestured her over with the sheepish gravity of someone about to ask something he feared might be obvious to everyone else.

“So,” he said, “this match thing. Is it... I don’t know... some loyalty program?”

Frankie snorted, a tiny, private sound. “No. It’s Augusta’s project.”

“Augusta?”

“My cousin.” A beat. “Visiting for a bit. Very thorough.”

// todo: fix this sentence
Her voice had the steady, unbothered warmth of someone who ran a diner well and saw no reason to add embellishment. She looked tired in the way people look tired when they are very good at their jobs and no longer need to prove it.

“People say it works,” she added, as though reporting on the weather.

“So I’m being set up?”

“Not unless you want to be.” She poured him more coffee without asking. “You can ignore it. Most folks do. Or pretend to.”

No inclination to explain further. She was already pivoting to greet a regular who’d slipped in behind him.

The man looked again at the slip of paper lying innocently beside his saucer. As if it had printed itself merely to pass the time.

// todo: fix
He noticed it only once he started looking for it. The little suggestions, tucked at the bottoms of other people’s checks like extra punctuation marks.

At the counter, the teenager with the milkshake picked up her receipt, read it, and grinned.

“Collaborator for your pottery class.”

She snapped a picture and sent it to someone with the speed of long practice.

Near the window, one of the construction workers read his own line -

“Jogging partner.”

He groaned theatrically. “I don’t jog,” he protested to no one in particular. The other worker clapped him on the back and said, “That’s why it’s a suggestion.”

At the far end, the laptop woman slid her bill under her palm:

“Person who returns your Tupperware.”

She blinked, once, a short laugh escaping her, like a note struck by accident.

// todo: fix the "or resigned.."
Nobody seemed confused by any of it. Mildly entertained, perhaps. Or accustomed, the way one becomes accustomed to the hiccups of the everyday: the one stoplight that never times right, the one neighbor who leaves zucchini on everyone’s porch.

The suggestions were strange — too specific to be meaningless, too gentle to be intrusive. They hovered between the absurd and the oddly insightful, like the diner somehow knew more about its patrons than they knew about themselves.

The man folded his slip and tucked it into his wallet. For later, he told himself, though he wasn’t sure what “later” meant.

The receipt printer behind the counter whirred, sputtered, then spat out another check as though clearing its throat. The sound carried a faint sense of deliberation. Frankie didn’t touch it. No one had pressed a button. The machine worked in its own rhythm: pauses that felt contemplative, followed by little bursts of decisiveness. Like someone muttering to themselves while solving a crossword.

The overhead lights hummed with a soft warmth, flickering not in the way of old fixtures but in a way that suggested attention — like they brightened half a shade whenever someone laughed, dimmed gently when a conversation turned private. The griddle’s low sizzle blended with the refrigerator’s steady breath, creating an odd harmony, a domestic heartbeat under the mundane noise.

The man watched as the printer finished with a theatrical final twitch - almost a flourish - and Frankie tore the paper free. She set it on a couple's table without ceremony. Neither diner looked surprised when they read the line at the bottom. They nodded once, like the match was something they’d expected.

Maybe everyone here had grown accustomed to the diner’s small murmurs of insight. Maybe nobody questioned where the suggestions came from because the explanation, if it existed, was less interesting than the matches.

The man lingered by the door for a moment, listening. The whole place seemed to exhale, a soft release of air that wasn’t mechanical so much as communal - an organism settling back into its posture after being briefly observed.

Outside, the highway roared indifferently. Here, something else was happening. Something quiet. Something that behaved as though checks had a pulse.

He stepped into the sunlight, receipt tucked securely in his wallet, the line about **LENORA — Wednesdays** repeating in the back of his mind like a tune he hadn’t meant to memorize.

# 2.

It was some time ago that the diner closed for an afternoon -  an event rare enough that locals might have taken pictures if they’d passed by. But they knew better than that. The handwritten sign on the door, *BE BACK TOMORROW — PROBABLY*, fluttered whenever a car whooshed past. The windows reflected a pale winter sun, giving the whole place the appearance of napping.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of bleach and lemon oil, as though Frankie had attempted a perfunctory cleaning before admitting defeat. The lights were set to half, casting long, slow shadows across the checkered floor.

Augusta stood in the aisle like an explorer surveying ruins. Her hair was shoved into a bun that had clearly been negotiated rather than styled. She wore a sweater with sleeves pushed past her elbows and a look of delighted overwhelm.

“I swear it wasn’t always such a mess,” Frankie muttered as she tried to shove a dolly - laden with boxes of mysterious provenance - toward the storage room.

Augusta smiled without teasing. “That’s because there was a system.”

“That’s generous,” Frankie returned.

The boxes were stacked in erratic towers, some leaning like they were tired of holding themselves up. A crate labeled *MYSTERY LIDS* sat atop a box labeled *EXTRA STRAWS (WHY SO MANY?)*.

Frankie bent to pick up a fallen dish towel. Augusta picked up a stack of menus, flipping through them as if they might contain secrets.

“Why do you have four versions of the breakfast menu?” Augusta asked.

“We kept redesigning it,” Frankie said. “But every time we printed a new draft, someone would complain the font looked funny.”

They laughed quietly together - an easy, shared rhythm that made the task feel more manageable.

Outside, the sound of snowmelt tapping onto a metal bucket offered a slow, rhythmic accompaniment.

The diner hummed—a low, collective murmur of refrigerators, lights, and vents—as though it were listening in.

Frankie braced herself and shouldered the storage room door open. It resisted with the stubbornness of a place that had been neglected long enough to develop opinions. When it finally gave way, something inside shifted with a soft *shfff*, and a box slid out, thumping against her boot.

“Oh no,” she said.

Augusta peeked over her shoulder and let out a low whistle.

The room was a chaos of cardboard: towers that leaned precariously, narrow passages between stacks, labels written in elegant handwriting - every letter precise, elegant, and a touch theatrical.

Augusta crouched. “Let’s see. Receipts A-C, 1998–2002.” She checked another. “Pie Orders, 1998.”

// todo: remove mention of johnny
She scanned the wall of boxes. “Johnny catalogued... everything?”

Frankie rubbed her face. “He liked patterns. Or maybe he liked the idea of them.”

Augusta lifted the lid of a box, releasing a dusty breath that smelled faintly of old paper and cinnamon. Inside were bundles of receipts tied with red-and-white baker’s twine. Each bundle had annotations: little circles around menu items, arrows between orders, tiny notes like *ask about her sister*, *same order every Thursday*, *avoid seating them near table 2 - acoustic issues?*.

“You have an archive,” Augusta whispered.

Frankie’s groan was half-embarrassment, half-affection.

Augusta pulled one bundle free and set it on the counter like it was fragile. The handwriting curled in soft loops along the margins. Each slip felt like a miniature diary entry from someone who had always noticed more than he let on.

The dining room felt suddenly smaller, or maybe warmer—memory pressing in without suffocating.

The next morning, Augusta arrived with a flatbed scanner that looked suspiciously fresh for something she claimed to have “borrowed.” It took up half the counter, its cord snake-trailing behind the pie display.

“Please tell me you’re not scanning *all* of it,” Frankie said, pouring herself a coffee.

“Not today,” Augusta said. “But soon. Paper fades. Memories too. Might as well save what we can.”

She set to work with clinical enthusiasm: lift a receipt, flatten it gently, press the lid of the scanner closed, tap the keyboard with a flourish. The machine hummed with a steady, patient rhythm.

Frankie watched her for a while, then wandered off to reorganize the tea shelf-a task she’d been avoiding for months. Every few minutes, the soft whir of the scanner drifted through the diner, creating a kind of irregular heartbeat.

“You know these aren’t historically important,” Frankie said eventually.

Augusta held up a receipt with a swirl of arrows and a note that said *ask about the dog park—he’ll appreciate it*.

“This check is history,” she said. “Just not the kind museums know how to display.”

Frankie didn’t answer. Wordlessly she set out two slices of pie.

The receipt printer across the room whirred once, abruptly, as if clearing its throat.

Augusta glanced over. “Do your appliances normally talk to each other?”

Frankie shrugged. “They’ve got opinions.”

***

It happened on a Tuesday. Of course it was a Tuesday.

Augusta had scanned thousands of receipts by then, feeding them into a simple indexing program she wrote to categorize dates, patrons, orders, and any scribbled observations. The program was basic - just enough to filter and search.

Except it wasn’t behaving like a basic program.

She searched a name to test something and the program suggested three others who were frequent booth-sharing companions. Except she hadn't asked it to. And none of their checks indicated anything about booth-sharing.

“Odd,” Augusta murmured.

She ran another query. The result flickered, then expanded into a cluster none of her logic accounted for.

“Frankie,” she called. “Your receipts are doing something weird.”

Before Frankie could ask what “weird” meant, the receipt printer sputtered and spat out a slip.

Frankie glanced instinctively over her shoulder. “Did you print something?”

“No,” Augusta said.

Frankie crossed the room. The slip read:

**You should ask her about Thursdays.**

“Her who?” Frankie asked.

The printer whirred again and produced a second slip.

It contained a single comma.

A perfectly centered, unassuming comma.

Augusta stared. “Okay. Now it’s definitely weird.”

The diner hummed around them, unbothered - as though it had simply added a new sound to its ambient repertoire.

Frankie went back to the griddle, muttering, “Not dealing with that thing today.”

Augusta kept watching the printer like it might continue speaking.

***

The first photo of a "suggestion receipt" appeared online courtesy of a tourist who’d stopped in for an omelet. Her slip read:
**Suggested collaborator for your quilt project.**

She posted it with three laughing emojis and the caption: *this diner is legit*, and the internet, being the internet, latched on.
x
Within days, the diner saw an uptick in customers - curious locals, intrigued travelers, people who claimed they “just happened to be passing through” despite having license plates from two states over.

The suggestions varied wildly: **Try the farmers’ market at dawn. You’ll meet him there.**; **Knitters’ circle—Mondays. Bring snacks.**; **Volunteer for the creek cleanup. You’ll like who shows up.**; **Ask about the lemon bars recipe. Trust us.**

A pair of retirees found a shared hobby after their receipts nudged them toward the same birdwatching group. A teenager discovered a friend who loved the same obscure space opera series. A pair of musicians realized they’d both been writing songs alone and started meeting on Thursdays.

People lingered longer. Conversations stretched. Laughter became more frequent, softer but richer.

A journalist came through and described the place as “an oracle disguised as a grill.” Frankie snorted through her nose when she read it but clipped the article and stuck it to the fridge.

The printer chugged along unbothered, offering its suggestions without fanfare. Frankie and Augusta didn’t try to explain it. They didn’t really want to.

It was enough that people kept finding each other.

# 3.

The office building is an ecosystem with the life scrubbed out of it. Everything gleams. Everything reflects. There are no corners, only strategic curves designed by someone who wrote a thesis on "workspace flow" but had never worked a restless day in their life.

Employees drift through the space in choreography that would appear synchronized if it didn’t radiate exhaustion. Their movements are oddly timed, like people following instructions remembered incorrectly from a dream.

Standing desks have repositioned themselves overnight—as if they were part of an ongoing architectural experiment. Tape outlines on the carpet reveal where furniture used to live, like chalk outlines for inanimate objects.

Monitors flicker with dashboards whose metrics are impossible to decipher: bars sliding without labels, circles orbiting one another like indecisive planets, numbers refreshing too fast to be read.

Managers walk in tight clusters, whispering sentences that sound like instructions but feel like rumors. "All teams should anticipate lateral integration." "No, I heard vertical integration." "Is 9F even a floor?"

Overhead, the announcement comes again:

**“Weekly re-org complete. Please check your pairing assignments.”**

It loops once.

Then glitches.

**“Please check your pairing assign—assign—assign—”**

The last syllable stutters like the building is clearing its throat.

No one reacts. Not anymore.

A woman strides by holding a stack of folders. "I’m on Pivot Team Four now. I was on Pivot Team Sixteen this morning." She says it with the flat resignation of someone reporting the weather.

A man whispers, "My pairing is a QR code. I don’t know if it’s a person or a helpdesk bot." No one responds.

The air tastes faintly metallic. The vents hum too loudly. The lighting seems to flicker at the edges of vision.

***

The all-hands auditorium is too big, too bright, too cold. The chairs all look the same: pale, rigid, designed for aesthetics rather than comfort. Every time someone shifts, the plastic creaks with an accusatory whine.

A cheerful executive in a blazer the color of bullet points strides onto the stage.

“Good afternoon, team!” she announces, with the brittle pep of someone who has slept only four hours but refuses to acknowledge it.

Behind her, the screen displays the company’s new initiative: **Synergetic Alignment Protocol.** The title is surrounded by graphics that pulse like a biometric monitor.

She clicks to the next slide. Arrows appear, connecting employee ID numbers like constellations. Employee clusters form and dissolve in real time, flashing from color to color. A heat map labeled **Compatibility Surfaces** spreads across the screen in ambiguous gradients.

“We’re thrilled to deploy our cutting-edge behavioral adjacency metrics,” she says.

Someone sneezes. The sound echoes.

“These insights allow us to dynamically reassign teams for optimal productivity. Trust the process!”

Her smile is too wide.

***

Mathi reaches his desk to discover it has been rearranged. Third time this month.

Half his monitors are missing. The other half face a different direction. His keyboard is balanced on its edge like someone tried to make it stand at attention. His chair is gone.

In its place is a generic seat with no lumbar support, no cushion, and adjustable levers in all the wrong places.

On his screen, a notification pulses:

**YOUR TEAM HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.**

Below it, another message:

**PAIR-7C4-ALN.Z**

The code pulses with a slow rhythm - two seconds on, one second off.

His chat explodes with messages:

“WHAT DO YOU MEAN OUR TEAM IS ARCHIVED?”
“Hello? Is anyone still here??”
“Where did the chairs go”
“Is anyone on Floor N?”
“Who is .Z ??”
“I think 7C4 is accounting???”

Mathi scrolls. Scrolls. Stops.

Closes the chat.

His stomach feels like it’s folding in on itself - not panic, but something slower, more resigned. Erosion.

He checks his assignment. It simply says:

**Report to Conference Room 11B.**

He checks the map. Conference Room 11B is not on the map.

He looks at the hallway directory. It lists Conference Rooms 11A, 11C, 11D, 11E.

No 11B.

He wanders past departments he didn’t know existed - "Future Client Possibilities" - "Vertical Strategy Optimizations" - "Meta-Client Alignment." He wonders if these floors existed yesterday.

Eventually he finds it: a door between two unused printers, unmarked except for a small plaque that reads "11B" in a font that looks apologetic.

The room is too quiet.

The lighting hums faintly with that particular frequency that makes teeth ache.

At the far end of a long, immaculate table sits Alma Church.

"Mathi?" she asks.

Her voice is steady - surprisingly so, given the swirling chaos beyond the door.

"Yeah," he says. "You’re Alma."

Her nod is polite but warm. A small thing. But noticeable.

They sit across from one another with delicately, like people trying to learn a dance they’ve never seen before.

Their introductions are formal - education, experience, recent projects. 

// todo: feels a little blunt
But as they talk, something small but unmistakable settles between them: a rhythm.

Halfway through describing her last role, Alma’s phone buzzes. She offers an apologetic gesture.

"Chess game with my sister. It’s my move."

She taps three times. Thinks. Taps a little more.

Phone facedown.

No elaboration. Just a conspiratorial grin.

Soon they're reviewing the project brief. It's uninspired, but it's something to do.

They don’t mirror each other. They complement each other.

// todo: hate this bit
Where Mathi sketches out a diagram, Alma suggests the connective tissue. Where Alma proposes a sequence, Mathi refines the waypoints. Where one hesitates, the other fills the quiet—not dominating, not eclipsing, simply offering.

It feels natural, easy. In a way that startles them both.

By the time they step out for lunch, they’ve developed a shorthand - a murmured agreement, a nod that carries meaning.

They order at the same moment:

// todo: right idea but need something a little more interesting
"Chicken rice bowl. Extra ginger."

Their heads snap toward each other.

A blink, then shared laughter.

***

As they return to their desks, the building feels more distorted.

Posters have appeared on the walls:

**COLLABORATE WITH YOUR ADJACENT.**
**PAIRING IS CARING.**
**CONSISTENT CHOICES CREATE CONSISTENT TEAMS.**

Someone has drawn a frowning face on that last one.

// todo: we could maybe lose this section, it's actually not necessary
In the break room, a chart is taped above the espresso machine. It’s titled **Culinary Clustering Patterns** and looks like a cross between a subway map and a weather forecast.

Colored dots labeled with initials drift toward categories like:

* "Lunch Loyalists"
* "Snack-Based Optimizers"
* "12:15 Outliers"

Someone whispers as Mathi and Alma walk past:

"They got paired off-menu."

The tone is half-bureaucratic, half-mythical.

Another person mutters, "Don’t order tuna. Just... don’t."

Mathi and Alma look at each other. They don’t comment. They don’t need to.

***

The building becomes stranger by the hour.

Pairings reshuffle constantly. Desks migrate. People wander hallways with vacant eyes, clutching printouts of new assignments like talismans.

Two designers are reassigned to write legal policy drafts. A lawyer is told to evaluate color palettes. An engineer stares at her screen and mutters, "I think my partner is a macro." 

Through it all, Mathi and Alma stay paired.

Their stability feels fragile, like a bubble that could burst if inspected too closely. But it lasts. 

They don’t say it aloud. They barely allude to it. But each knows the other is the only part of this building that makes any kind of sense.

Their partnership feels like something the system didn’t intend. Or didn’t quite manage to break.

# 4.

The diner was in one of its long, honey-colored hours, the kind that seemed to stretch time rather than pass through it. Sunlight slanted in at an angle that made every chrome surface glow. The air held that particular late-afternoon softness - like the inside of a seashell - where sound pooled but didn’t echo.

Mathi and Alma had taken the booth beneath the large front window, the one where the blinds were always slightly crooked. Their screens glowed with green pins, soil moisture readings, volunteer sign-up notes, growing-season projections. It had begun as a small idea - something they’d joked about - and now it was quietly gathering form. The map had a living quality. The cluster of green markers felt like seedlings pushing up through digital soil. Where the pins thickened, it gave the impression of vines exploring new terrain. Where they thinned, it looked like a trellis waiting for someone to train a branch along it.

Frankie approached.

“Your forest’s getting bigger,” she said, studying the screen.

“It’s not a forest yet,” Alma replied.

“Well, it looks like it wants to be,” Frankie said, which somehow mattered.

The receipt printer at the counter produced a new slip for a trio of students hunched over milkshakes and textbooks. They giggled at whatever had been suggested, exchanging looks of conspiratorial delight.

The diner was in a benevolent mood that day - watchful, patient, amused by the world finding its way.

Mathi noticed a small patch of paint on the far wall he’d never really looked at before - a tiny chipped area revealing older colors underneath. Peach beneath cream, beneath an even older shade of dusty blue. The place was layered, lived-in, accumulated. Like tree rings that didn’t bother arranging themselves into tidy circles.

He exhaled. His whole body softened.

// todo: might be a little too suggestive
Alma nudged him gently with her knee, wordlessly asking if he was okay.

He gave her the half-smile reserved for people who already understand the answer.

They worked in a silence that wasn’t empty. It felt more like the silence of a garden: the quiet that’s full of small, earnest activity.

Alma’s phone buzzed once. She lifted it, read, and tilted the screen toward him.

The headline read like a parody of itself: **SYSTEMIC ALIGNMENT PROJECT SHIFTING TO STRATEGIC PIVOT.**

Mathi barked an incredulous laugh. “That’s one way to put it.”

He skimmed the article. Phrases leapt out at him: *behavioral adjacency misfires*, *unintended redeployment spirals*, *role dissolution events*, *compatibility misinterpretation*.

// todo: too blunt
He winced. The language felt like someone describing a broken relationship using only engineering terms.

“They never say what actually happened,” he murmured.

“They won’t,” Alma said. She spooned some foam from her tea and let it dissolve again. “Wall Street admits collapse the way people admit heartbreak. With a rebound.”

He glanced around the diner. A teenager in a letterman jacket was showing his grandmother how to use a QR code. A pair of paramedics shared pancakes after a long shift. A man in a paint-splattered hoodie sketched ideas on the back of a placemat.

“That place feels like an ancient memory,” he said.

“Good riddance,” Alma replied.

Their shoulders relaxed at the same time.

The kitchen door swung open with a soft thump, and Augusta appeared balancing a tower of clean glasses in one arm, an unruly pile of sketches under another. She always looked like she was listening - to the building, to the customers, to the quiet logic of how people move when they’re not pretending.

She paused when she saw Mathi and Alma bent over their project.

// todo: too much 'up to something' here
“You two look like you’re up to something,” she said.

“We are,” Alma said, not looking up from her screen.

Frankie emerged with a box of napkins tucked under her arm. She set it down with a sigh, then froze when she saw Augusta's pile.

“Ugh,” Frankie said. “Are you thinking of expanding again?”

Augusta blinked with exaggerated innocence. “I’m only sketching. Sketching isn’t expanding.”

“It’s pre-expanding,” Frankie said.

Mathi stirred. “What's going on?”

Frankie and Augusta exchanged a glance that was hard to decipher - half deflection, half excitement.

“Nothing,” Frankie said.

“Something,” Augusta corrected archly.

The sketches were subtle: schematic lines, penciled notes about windows, arrows pointing to imagined breezeways. No two drawings looked alike. One showed a long, narrow café tucked beside a laundromat. Another depicted a sunlit room with a single communal table. A third had a rooftop patio full of potted citrus trees.

Frankie tapped the notepad. “People keep asking us how the printer works. Whether we could start another place somewhere. But this diner is... this diner.”

“It doesn’t want to be duplicated,” Augusta said.

“But maybe,” Frankie said slowly, “there’s such a thing as cousins.”

Mathi felt something expand in the air. Not ambition. Not empire. More like branches - stretching outward at their own pace, following the light.

Augusta pulled out the sketch at the bottom of the pile - a drawing of a building that resembled the diner if you squinted, but the details were different. More plants. Wider windows. A porch meant for lingering.

“I think of it like a network,” she said, making a face at the word. “But that's not quite right.”

Frankie glared. “If anyone suggests a franchise model, I’ll throw their pancakes out the window.”

Augusta tapped the drawing again. “I’m thinking about places that know each other. Places that hear the same wind. Like trees in a grove. They don’t match, but they rhyme.”

Mathi nodded slowly. “Like how a root system isn’t organized the way people want it to be.”

“Yes!” Augusta said. “Messy on paper, perfect in practice.”

// todo: ugh
“There’s a kind of wisdom in it,” Alma said. “A quiet one.”

Augusta’s eyes sparkled. “Not instructions. Not predictions. Just... noticing. And offering.”

“This sketch feels like it wants to exist,” Alma said.

Frankie rolled her eyes, shrugged. “If it starts printing me blueprints, I’m quitting.”

From the counter, the receipt printer whirred softly, almost teasing.

***

They had soup for dinner - miso for Alma, lentil curry for Mathi.

Frankie left their check face down on the table, a casual gesture. Mathi reached for it, more out of habit than anything, but paused when he turned it over.

The numbers were there - subtotal, tax, a polite space for tip. But at the bottom, tucked almost shyly into the lower margin, were two words printed in the smallest font the machine could manage:

// todo: kind of hate this
**good team**
