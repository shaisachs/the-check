Frankie's head bent over the calculator, strands of wavy hair floating in the breeze of the fan and occasionally bothering her figures. As her fingers flew across the keys the printer tape advanced steadily outward, spilling past the edge of the desk and onto the floor.

She enjoyed spinning the thread of numbers in this way, though it was an arduous task that she regretted in hindsight every quarter. There was something pure in the ache of it all, something noble about making these little slips of papers, these greasy old receipts, gather together into a nice, tidy column.

She finished a stack and looked up, as though someone else might have been standing over her. But there was no one in the cramped little office, just her desk and a chair opposite, struggling under the weight of a full years' worth of grubby paperworkj.

A year had passed since Johnny had died.

Once the initial shock faded, and the funeral passed, and the stream of mourners slowed to a trickle, Frankie reopened the diner. At first it seemed like an insult to his memory, to hire a line cook to take his place. With time, Frankie realized that the diner was exactly what she needed. The routine of opening the doors each morning, the flow of boisterous customers, the sizzle of eggs cracking over the griddle - it all felt right, somehow. Surely Johnny would have approved.

The loneliness was its own kind of company, she found. The bare lightbulb hanging overhead, a single beam of light illuminating the dusty and windowless office - there was nothing she preferred, when working on the books. There was a reason she didn't camp out at a booth in the diner, as Johnny sometimes liked to do, to be enveloped by the clatter of plates and the gurgle of chatter at the other tables. Why bother with all the well-wishers who would inevitably pass by, when she had a perfectly nice box of receipts at her fingertips?

It was not the greasy food that took Johnny away, surprisingly. He sampled his own wares quite freely, but never had so much as an uncomfortable checkup at the doctor's. Something of a modern miracle, the doctor used to say, a cook at a greasy spoon with a healthy ticker. Johnny liked to repeat that line often, it was like a magical talisman decorating his neck. Frankie sometimes wondered if it was the repetition itself which brought him good health; doctors always had tricks like that up their sleeves.

Frankie got up, stretched, put on her jacket and went outside through the back door. Across the street from a diner was a tiny little park, just a scrap of grass really, but at the far edge stood a copse of pine trees. It was a nice spot to relax from time to time, the sort of place she could let her mind wander. The bench underneath was rarely inhabited, and Frankie planted herself there. Through the branches of the tree, little spindles of afternoon light fell on the ground, forming a pattern she couldn't quite discern.

Johnny did not observe many rituals in his time, but he did have a habit of writing out receipts for his own lunches at the diner. It was a funny thing to do, and at first Frankie supposed that he was trying to help her keep the books intact - not that it really made much difference. But that wasn't it after all, because she found that more often than not he didn't even know that she had paid taxes. It was several years after starting the diner that he discovered they had any kind of budget at all. Perhaps the mounting collection of receipts was his own kind of journal, a slow and small testament to his daily life. It was impossible to know. One way or the other, she was left with a box full of her husband's accumulated lunch orders, about the weight and heft of a skein of wool. It was these that she placed on the bench beside her, thrumming the lid absently with her fingers.

It was a quiet afternoon, with only a few birds hopping among the branches of the trees above her. Occasionally she'd hear the chirpy report of a sparrow, the trilled complaint of a robin. She could not quite name the reason she had brought the box with her. She had left the diner was to get away from work for a minute, she certainly didn't intend to bring it with her. She had other keepsakes of Johnny's, an old jacket and a favorite basbeall, countless spatulas. She didn't really want those today. She opened the lid and sifted the greasy scraps of paper through her fingers.

A whole season had gone by, once, when Johnny had nothing but eggs and toast for lunch. He swore by it as though it was the perfect lunch, and then one day, he switched to chicken clubs. He could be like that, sometimes, finicky. Temperamental. Those were good years, simple. The diner wasn't doing terribly well, it was all they had: a sizzling griddle, loyal customers, idle walks down the street in the middle of the day when business was slow.

When was that? Two years ago? Five?

Frankie rifled through the receipts, her fingers padding through as though one scrap of paper or the other might contain the answer.

Of course it was not any one scrap of paper, but several of them put together that held the answer. But did it matter, really? What was the difference between two years, and two decades, when it came to something as fleeting as a memory? She would not be able to recover those days, even if she could reconstruct every last detail of that bygone season. Johnny was gone, the diner was far too successful; a walk down Main Street in the middle of the day was no longer all that peaceful.

Frankie's eyebrows gathered into a frown. Still, she had to know.

It was later that day when she cracked the lid open on her laptop and created a database she called "Johnny's checks." She thought, briefly, about creating a gizmo - or buying one, surely there was a way to buy one - that would read all of his receipts, one by one, and turn them into records for her database. She decided against it out of sheer obstinance; that would take time and she didn't want to bother. She wanted the answer to her question, not another mess of screws and wires on her desk. Once the question entered her mind, she simply couldn't let go of it.
